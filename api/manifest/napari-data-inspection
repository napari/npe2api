    "description": "# Napari Data Inspection\n\nA napari plugin for fast, high-throughput inspection of 2D/3D segmentation datasets.\nSelect one or more images and/or labels layers; files are paired and loaded automatically so you can browse entire datasets without manual effort.\n\n## Features\n\n- Multi-folder pairing: any number of image/label folders\n- Prefetching & caching for steamless navigation\n- Supports common formats (e.g., NIfTI, TIFF, PNG, NRRD, MHA, B2ND) out of the box.\n- Extensible loaders (add your own formats if needed).\n\n## Installation\n\n```bash\n# a) Install the plugin\npip install napari-data-inspection\n# b) Install the plugin and napari if necessary\npip install napari-data-inspection[all]\n```\n\n## Quickstart\n\n```\nnapari -w napari-data-inspection\n```\n\n<img src=\"https://github.com/MIC-DKFZ/napari-data-inspection/raw/main/imgs/GUI.png\">\n\n# Data organization\n\n- Filter files by patterns (e.g., \\*\\_img.nii.gz, \\*\\_seg.nii.gz) and/or separate folders per layer.\n- Number of files must match across layers; pairs are made by sorted order.\n\n### 1. Separate folders per layer\n\nPut each layer\u2019s files in its own directory.\n\n```\n/data/images/\n  case001.nii.gz\n  case002.nii.gz\n/data/labels/\n  case001.nii.gz\n  case002.nii.gz\n```\n\n### 2. By Patterns\n\nUse patterns (globs) per layer.\n\n```\n/data/\n  case001_img.nii.gz\n  case001_seg.nii.gz\n  case002_img.nii.gz\n  case002_seg.nii.gz\n```\n\nPatterns\n\n```\nImages: *_img.nii.gz\nLabels: *_seg.nii.gz\n```\n\n## Supported file types\n\nThe data loading is based on the [ViData](%22https://github.com/MIC-DKFZ/ViData?tab=readme-ov-file#imaging-and-array-data%22) package.\nThe following Extensions and Backends are available.\n\n| Extension(s)                       | Backend(s)  | Notes                                                              |\n| ---------------------------------- | ----------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------ |\n| `.png`, `.jpg`, `.jpeg`, `.bmp`    | `imageio`   | Standard 2D image formats                                          |\n| `.tif`, `.tiff`                    | `tifffile`  | Multipage TIFF; high bit-depths supported                          |\n| `.nii.gz`, `.nii`, `.mha`, `.nrrd` | `sitk`      | Medical image formats (3D volumes)                                 |\n| `.nii.gz`, `.nii`                  | `nibabel`   | Alternative medical imaging backend                                |\n| `.b2nd`                            | `blosc2`    | Compressed N-dimensional arrays                                    |\n| `.b2nd`                            | `blosc2pkl` | Compressed N-dimensional arrays with metadata in a separate `.pkl` |\n| `.npy`                             | `numpy`     | Single NumPy array                                                 |\n\n### Custom Load Functions\n\n- Register a reader with a decorator.\n- Reader must return (numpy_array, metadata_dict).\n- Registration happens at import time\u2014make sure this module is imported (e.g., from your package\u2019s __init__.py).\n- See [here](https://github.com/MIC-DKFZ/ViData/blob/main/src/vidata/io/image_io.py) for an example.\n- metadata should contain an \"affine\" if entry, if any spatial transformation should be applied\n\n```py\n# custom_io_template.py  \u2014 fill in the TODOs and import this module somewhere at startup.\nimport numpy as np\nfrom typing import Tuple, Dict, List\n\n# TODO: import your backend library (e.g., imageio, tifffile, nibabel, SimpleITK, ...)\n# import imageio.v3 as iio\n\nfrom vidata.registry import register_loader, register_writer\n\n# --------------------------- READER ------------------------------------------\n# Replace file extension and backend name to your custom function\n@register_loader(\"image\", \".png\", \".jpg\", \".jpeg\", \".bmp\", backend=\"imageio\")  # To Register Image Loading\n@register_loader(\"mask\", \".png\", \".bmp\", backend=\"imageio\") # To Register Label Loading\ndef load_custom(file: str) -> tuple[np.ndarray, dict]:\n    \"\"\"\n    Load a file and return (data, metadata).\n    metadata can be empty or include keys like: spacing, origin, direction, shear, dtype, etc.\n    \"\"\"\n    # data = iio.imread(file)  # example for imageio\n    data = ...  # TODO: replace\n    meta = {}   # TODO: replace\n    return data, meta\n```\n\n### Torch Dataset Inspection\n\n- Rapid inspection of PyTorch datasets in Napari by browsing images and corresponding labels directly from any torch.utils.data.Dataset\n\n```py\nfrom napari_data_inspection.dataset_inspection import DatasetInspectionWidget, run_dataset_inspection\nfrom torch.utils.data import Dataset\n\n# Example: inspect a PyTorch dataset\ndataset = MyCustomDataset(...)  # any torch Dataset\nrun_dataset_inspection(dataset, channel_first=True, rescale=True, no_label=False, bg_class=0)\n```\n\n# Acknowledgments\n\n<p align=\"left\">\n  <img src=\"https://github.com/MIC-DKFZ/napari-data-inspection/raw/main/imgs/Logos/HI_Logo.png\" width=\"150\"> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <img src=\"https://github.com/MIC-DKFZ/napari-data-inspection/raw/main/imgs/Logos/DKFZ_Logo.png\" width=\"500\">\n</p>\n\nThis repository is developed and maintained by the Applied Computer Vision Lab (ACVL)\nof [Helmholtz Imaging](https://www.helmholtz-imaging.de/) and the\n[Division of Medical Image Computing](https://www.dkfz.de/en/medical-image-computing) at DKFZ.\n\nThis [napari] plugin was generated with [copier] using the [napari-plugin-template].\n\n[copier]: https://copier.readthedocs.io/en/stable/\n[napari]: https://github.com/napari/napari\n[napari-plugin-template]: https://github.com/napari/napari-plugin-template\n",
