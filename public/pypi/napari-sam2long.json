Users can provide input and make corrections through point clicks or manually drawn masks.\n\nThe tool leverages the [SAM2Long](https://github.com/Mark12Ding/SAM2Long) model, an optimized version of [Meta's SAM 2](https://github.com/facebookresearch/sam2) with enhancements to the memory module for improved performance on long videos. It was built to support long videos, but it remains effective for shorter videos as well.\n\nThis [napari] plugin was generated with [copier] using the [napari-plugin-template].\n\n<h3 align=\"center\">Select object with point prompts</h3>\n<p align=\"middle\">\n  <img src=\"https://github.com/maihanhoang/napari-sam2long/raw/main/assets/napari-sam2long-firstLabel.gif\" width=\"100%\" />\n</p>\n\n<h3 align=\"center\">Refine object selection with napari tools </h3>\n<p align=\"middle\">\n  <img src=\"https://github.com/maihanhoang/napari-sam2long/raw/main/assets/napari-sam2long-anotherLabel.gif\" width=\"100%\" />\n</p>\n\n\n## Installation\nPlease see the official [SAM 2](https://github.com/facebookresearch/sam2) repo and the [INSTALL.md](https://github.com/facebookresearch/sam2/blob/main/INSTALL.md) for notes and FAQs on potential installation issues.\n\n1. Create a new conda environment with python>=3.10 and install napari:\n    ```bash\n    conda create -n napari-sam2long python==3.10\n    conda activate napari-sam2long\n    python -m pip install \"napari[all]\"\n    ```\n\n2. Install PyTorch and TorchVision. Select preferences [here](https://pytorch.org/get-started/locally/) to find correct installation command.\n\n    Example command can look like this:\n\n    ```bash\n    pip3 install torch torchvision torchaudio --index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cu126\n    ```\n\n3. Install SAM2Long:\n    ```bash\n    git clone git@github.com:maihanhoang/napari-sam2long.git\n\n    cd napari-sam2long/SAM2Long && pip install -e .\n    ```\n4. Install napari-SAM2Long plugin:\n    ```bash\n    cd .. && pip install e .\n    ```\n\n## Usage\n\n### Segmenting & tracking first object\n1. **Open a 3D tiff** in napari, make sure it's in TYX or ZYX format.\n2. **Select** the image in the ***Input*** dropdown.\n3. **Add a new [labels layer](https://napari.org/0.5.0/howtos/layers/labels.html)** *after* the input image, then select it in the *Labels* dropdown.\n\n    The labels layer must be added after the image to ensure dimension alignment.\n4. **Select the *Model***.\n5. **Click *Initialize*** to load the image and initialize the inference state.\n6. **Define the initial object mask** on any frame:\n    - Use the mouse middle-click to prompt the model:\n        - *Middle-click* = add region\n        - *Ctrl + middle-click* = remove region\n    - Or use napari's built-in tools (paintbrush, eraser, etc.) to draw the mask manually.\n\n    If the model doesn\u2019t segment the object accurately with point prompts, manual correction using napari tools can be useful.\n\n7. Once satisfied with the initial mask, **click *Propagate from current frame*** to obtain segmentations for all subsequent frames. The result will be added to the labels layer.\n\n    Propagation only affects future frames. It does not recompute previous ones or consider prompts from other frames. Only the current mask is used to propagate forward.\n\n### Making corrections\n8. To refine segmentation, add/remove regions use:\n    - *(Ctrl+) middle-click* prompts\n    - napari\u2019s label tools\n9. *Propagate from current frame* to re-run the model's predictions with the new mask.\n\n    The plugin treats this as a new initial mask and discards earlier prompts on that frame.\n\n### Segmenting another object in the same image/video\n10. Save the current labels layer (to preserve previous segmentation).\n11. Click *Reset*, or add a new labels layer and select it in the *Labels* dropdown.\nThen repeat steps from Step 6 for the next object.\n\n###  Segment new image/video\n12. *Reset* inference state.\n13. Load new image and follow instructions starting from Step 1.\n    *Initialize* is necessary to load the new image.\n\n## Contributing\n\nContributions are very welcome.

No endorsement. Nothing in this Public License constitutes or\n                  may be construed as permission to assert or imply that You\n                  are, or that Your use of the Licensed Material is, connected\n                  with, or sponsored, endorsed, or granted official status by,\n                  the Licensor or others designated to receive attribution as\n                  provided in Section 3(a)(1)(A)(i).\n        \n          b.

Patent and trademark rights are not licensed under this\n                  Public License.\n        \n               3. To the extent possible, the Licensor waives any right to\n                  collect royalties from You for the exercise of the Licensed\n                  Rights, whether directly or through a collecting society\n                  under any voluntary or waivable statutory or compulsory\n                  licensing scheme.

UNLESS OTHERWISE SEPARATELY UNDERTAKEN BY THE LICENSOR, TO THE\n             EXTENT POSSIBLE, THE LICENSOR OFFERS THE LICENSED MATERIAL AS-IS\n             AND AS-AVAILABLE, AND MAKES NO REPRESENTATIONS OR WARRANTIES OF\n             ANY KIND CONCERNING THE LICENSED MATERIAL, WHETHER EXPRESS,\n             IMPLIED, STATUTORY, OR OTHER. THIS INCLUDES, WITHOUT LIMITATION,\n             WARRANTIES OF TITLE, MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR\n             PURPOSE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, ABSENCE OF LATENT OR OTHER DEFECTS,\n             ACCURACY, OR THE PRESENCE OR ABSENCE OF ERRORS, WHETHER OR NOT\n             KNOWN OR DISCOVERABLE. WHERE DISCLAIMERS OF WARRANTIES ARE NOT\n             ALLOWED IN FULL OR IN PART, THIS DISCLAIMER MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.\n        \n          b. TO THE EXTENT POSSIBLE, IN NO EVENT WILL THE LICENSOR BE LIABLE\n             TO YOU ON ANY LEGAL THEORY (INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION,\n             NEGLIGENCE) OR OTHERWISE FOR ANY DIRECT, SPECIAL, INDIRECT,\n             INCIDENTAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE, EXEMPLARY, OR OTHER LOSSES,\n             COSTS, EXPENSES, OR DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THIS PUBLIC LICENSE OR\n             USE OF THE LICENSED MATERIAL, EVEN IF THE LICENSOR HAS BEEN\n             ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH LOSSES, COSTS, EXPENSES, OR\n             DAMAGES. WHERE A LIMITATION OF LIABILITY IS NOT ALLOWED IN FULL OR\n             IN PART, THIS LIMITATION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.\n        \n          c. The disclaimer of warranties and limitation of liability provided\n             above shall be interpreted in a manner that, to the extent\n             possible, most closely approximates an absolute disclaimer and\n             waiver of all liability.\n        \n        Section 6 -- Term and Termination.\n        \n          a. This Public License applies for the term of the Copyright and\n             Similar Rights licensed here. However, if You fail to comply with\n             this Public License, then Your rights under this Public License\n             terminate automatically.\n        \n          b. Where Your right to use the Licensed Material has terminated under\n             Section 6(a), it reinstates:\n        \n               1. automatically as of the date the violation is cured, provided\n                  it is cured within 30 days of Your discovery of the\n                  violation; or\n        \n               2. upon express reinstatement by the Licensor.\n        \n             For the avoidance of doubt, this Section 6(b) does not affect any\n             right the Licensor may have to seek remedies for Your violations\n             of this Public License.\n        \n          c. For the avoidance of doubt, the Licensor may also offer the\n             Licensed Material under separate terms or conditions or stop\n             distributing the Licensed Material at any time; however, doing so\n             will not terminate this Public License.\n        \n          d. Sections 1, 5, 6, 7, and 8 survive termination of this Public\n             License.\n        \n        Section 7 -- Other Terms and Conditions.\n        \n          a. The Licensor shall not be bound by any additional or different\n             terms or conditions communicated by You unless expressly agreed.\n        \n          b. Any arrangements, understandings, or agreements regarding the\n             Licensed Material not stated herein are separate from and\n             independent of the terms and conditions of this Public License.\n        \n        Section 8 -- Interpretation.\n        \n          a. For the avoidance of doubt, this Public License does not, and\n             shall not be interpreted to, reduce, limit, restrict, or impose\n             conditions on any use of the Licensed Material that could lawfully\n             be made without permission under this Public License.\n        \n          b. To the extent possible, if any provision of this Public License is\n             deemed unenforceable, it shall be automatically reformed to the\n             minimum extent necessary to make it enforceable. If the provision\n             cannot be reformed, it shall be severed from this Public License\n             without affecting the enforceability of the remaining terms and\n             conditions.\n        \n          c. No term or condition of this Public License will be waived and no\n             failure to comply consented to unless expressly agreed to by the\n             Licensor.\n        \n          d. Nothing in this Public License constitutes or may be interpreted\n             as a limitation upon, or waiver of, any privileges and immunities\n             that apply to the Licensor or You, including from the legal\n             processes of any jurisdiction or authority.\n        \n        \n        \n        Creative Commons is not a party to its public\n        licenses.
