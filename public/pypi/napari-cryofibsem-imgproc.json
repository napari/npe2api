Using the widgets, the user can choose the input image or stack, set the function parameters, and call the function. These functions can be used in sequence with each other or individually, depending on the image processing requirements. \n\n![widget.png](widget.png)\n\n## Contributing\n\nContributions are very welcome. Tests can be run with [tox], please ensure\nthe coverage at least stays the same before you submit a pull request.\n\n## License\n\nDistributed under the terms of the [Apache Software License 2.0] license,\n\"napari-cryofibsem-imgproc\" is free and open source software\n\n## Issues\n\nIf you encounter any problems, please [file an issue] along with a detailed description.\n\n[napari]: https://github.com/napari/napari\n[Cookiecutter]: https://github.com/audreyr/cookiecutter\n[@napari]: https://github.com/napari\n[MIT]: http://opensource.org/licenses/MIT\n[BSD-3]: http://opensource.org/licenses/BSD-3-Clause\n[GNU GPL v3.0]: http://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-3.0.txt\n[GNU LGPL v3.0]: http://www.gnu.org/licenses/lgpl-3.0.txt\n[Apache Software License 2.0]: http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0\n[Mozilla Public License 2.0]: https://www.mozilla.org/media/MPL/2.0/index.txt\n[cookiecutter-napari-plugin]: https://github.com/napari/cookiecutter-napari-plugin\n\n[file an issue]: https://github.com/EMCRUMC/napari-cryofibsem-imgproc/issues\n\n[napari]: https://github.com/napari/napari\n[tox]: https://tox.readthedocs.io/en/latest/\n[pip]: https://pypi.org/project/pip/\n[PyPI]: https://pypi.org/\n",
