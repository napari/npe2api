So no choice to use CPU is provided in the plugin. Besides, as the code is depended on PyTorch and `triton` packages, you should install the plugin through command lines.\n\nI recommand you to install the plugin in a new envoroment created by `conda` .\n\n First, create a new environment with `conda` and activate it.\n```\nconda create -y --name napari-fluoresfm python=3.12\nconda activate napari-fluoresfm\n```\n\nThen, install `napari`.\n```\npip install -U \"napari[all]\"\n```\n\nTo use GPU for inference and training, you should install the GPU version of PyTorch. You can use `nvcc -V` to check the cuda version. Then install the corresponding version of PyTorch by check the [table](https://pytorch.org/get-started/previous-versions/) provided by PyTorch. For example, if you have `cuda 12.4`, you should install the following version of PyTorch.\n```\npip install torch==2.6.0 torchvision==0.21.0 torchaudio==2.6.0 --index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cu124\n```\n\nWe recommend you using Linux for training and inference, as the `triton` support for Windows is not stable. And the with Linux system, the acceleration of `triton` is much better than Windows, which allow larger `batch size` and `patch size` to be used in training and inference.\n\nIf you are using Windows, you should install the `triton` package first according the PyTorch version you installed. Please check this [link](https://github.com/woct0rdho/triton-windows?tab=readme-ov-file#3-pytorch) for more details.\n```\npip install -U \"triton-windows<3.3\"\n```\n\n## Installation\n\nYou can install `napari-fluoresfm` via [pip]:\n\n```\npip install napari-fluoresfm\n```\n\nTo install latest development version :\n\n```\npip install git+https://github.com/qiqi-lu/napari-fluoresfm.git\n```\n\n## Functions\nThis plugin can be used for data preprocessing, model training, and model inference.\n\n![interface](src/napari_fluoresfm/images/interface.png)\n**Figure 1: The interface of the plugin.** **a** The label page uased for prediction of restored images. **b** The page for data preprocessing, including data patching and text embedding modules. **c** The page for model training.\n\n**Each page can be run independetly. You only need to input the data and model information as described below from top to bottom, and click `run` button to start. To train or fine-tune the mdoel, you need to preprocess the data firstly using the `Preprocess` page. The training and fine-tuning can both be done in `Train` page.**\n\n### Predict\nThis label page is used for prediction of restored images. You can select the pretrained model and the input image to predict the restored image.\n#### PATH box\nThis box is used to select the folder for data and models.\n- **Input Folder**: The folder containing the input images. The input images should be in `.tif` format with a shape of `(1, H, W)` or `(H, W)`. The model will restored the images one by one and save them into the **Output Folder**.\n- **Index File**: This should be a `.txt` file containing all the file names of the images to be restored in each line. The file name should be the same as the file name of the input images.\n- **Output Folder** (optional): The folder to save the restored images. If not specified, the restored images will be saved into the `#Input Folder#_fluoresfm`.\n- **Embedder**: The folder saved the text embedder model. You can download the text model from my [Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1pfiCHtXrf5ne6fjKJQAvwQhgBO_yVpWy?usp=sharing).\n- **Checkpoint**: The pre-trained FluoResFM model checkpoint with a suffix `.pt`.\n\n#### PARAMETERS box\nThis box is used to set the parameters for prediction.\n- **Device**: The device to run the model.

Larger batch size will use more memory and faster inference. If your GPU memory is not enough, you can reduce this value.\n- **Patch size**: The patch size used during inference. Larger patch size will use more memory. If your GPU memory is not enough, you can reduce this value. Different pacth size may lead to slightly different results due to the patch stiching process.\n#### TEXT box\nThis box is used to set the text prompt for the model.\n- **Task**: The task to be performed. For example, \"denoising\", \"deconvolution\", or \"super-resolution with a scale factor of 2\".

Other tasks may result in unexpected results as the model is not trained for these tasks.\n- **Sample**: The image sample. For example, \"fixed COS-7 cell line\".\n- **Structure**: The imaging structure. For example, \"microtubules\".\n- **Fluorescence indicator**: The fluorescence indicator.

Such as, \"linear structured illumination microscopy\".\n    - **Mircoscopy params**: The microscope parameters. For example, \"with excitation numrical aperture (NA) of 1.35, detection namerical aperture (NA) of 1.3\".\n    - **Pixel size**: The pixel size of the image.
