    "description": "# Napari Toolkit\n\nA napari toolkit for handling QWidgets to simplify the development of Napari plugins.\nThe toolkit provides enhanced widgets, UI components, and utilities that streamline plugin creation, improve layout management, and enhance user interaction within the Napari ecosystem.\n\n\n## Installation\n#### 1. Install `napari_toolkit`\n```shell\npip install napari-toolkit\n```\nor clone the repository:\n```shell\ngit clone https://github.com/MIC-DKFZ/napari_toolkit.git\ncd napari_toolkit\npip install -e ./\n```\n#### 2. (Optional) Initialize your Plugin\nAfterward it is recommended to generate you plugin with [copier] using the [napari-plugin-template].\n\n---\n\n## Gallery\n\n````python\nfrom

Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,\n              whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,\n              unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly\n              negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be\n              liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,\n              incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a\n              result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the\n              Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,\n              work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all\n              other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor\n              has been advised of the possibility of such damages.\n        \n           9.
