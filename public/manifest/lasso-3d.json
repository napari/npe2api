Rotate and project polygon to 2D and create a pixel mask\n2. Create a 3D mask by stacking the pixel mask along z\n3. Rotate 3D mask s.t. it is aligned with the original polygon\n\nThis performed more efficiently than the other methods:\n\n### Mask via projection\nSteps:\n1. Project all points onto the hyperplane defined by the polygon\n2. Rotate all points and the polygon s.t. they are in a horizontal plane and remove z component\n3. Create a binary pixel mask of the polygon\n4. Check which point projections are within the polygon mask\n5. reshape mask to original tomogram size\n\n### Mask via mesh voxelization\nSteps:\n1. Move polygon along its normal in both directions until end of tomogram shape --> front & back polygons\n2. Define a surface by combining front & back polygons into a triangular mesh\n3. Voxelize the surface, giving the outline of the cone\n4. Fill holes to receive a filled cone\n\n### Mask via attaching slices\nSteps:\n1. Rotate and project polygon to 2D and generate a pixel mask (2D)\n2. Get indices of pixel mask and rotate them back to 3D space\n3. Do that for many pixel mask, varying the z-component --> will be moved into tomogram along the polygon normal\n4. Binary closing to get rid of holes from integer conversion\n\n## Installation\n\npip install .\n<!-- You can install `lasso-3d` via [pip]:\n\n    pip install lasso-3d\n\n\n\nTo install latest development version :\n\n    pip install git+https://github.com/LorenzLamm/lasso-3d.git -->\n\n\n## Contributing\n\nContributions are very welcome.
