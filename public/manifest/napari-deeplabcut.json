If the user clicked on the image(s) layer first, does `Save As`, then closes the window, any labeling work during that session will be lost!\n\n\n### Video frame extraction and prediction refinement\n\nSince v0.0.4, videos can be viewed in the GUI.\n\nSince v0.0.5, trailing points can be visualized; e.g., helping in the identification\nof swaps or outlier, jittery predictions.\n\nLoading a video (and its corresponding output h5 file) will enable the video actions\nat the top of the dock widget: they offer the option to manually extract video\nframes from the GUI, or to define cropping coordinates.\nNote that keypoints can be displaced and saved, as when annotating individual frames.\n\n\n## Workflow\n\nSuggested workflows, depending on the image folder contents:\n\n1. **Labeling from scratch** \u2013 the image folder does not contain `CollectedData_<ScorerName>.h5` file.\n\n    Open *napari* as described in [Usage](#usage) and open an image folder together with the DeepLabCut project's `config.yaml`.\n    The image folder creates an *image layer* with the images to label.\n    Supported image formats are: `jpg`, `jpeg`, `png`.\n    The `config.yaml` file creates a *Points layer*, which holds metadata (such as keypoints read from the config file) necessary for labeling.\n    Select the *Points layer* in the layer list (lower left pane on the GUI) and click on the *+*-symbol in the layer controls menu (upper left pane) to start labeling.\n    The current keypoint can be viewed/selected in the keypoints dropdown menu (right pane).\n    The slider below the displayed image (or the left/right arrow keys) allows selecting the image to label.\n\n    To save the labeling progress refer to [Save Layers](#save-layers).\n    `Data successfully saved` should be shown in the status bar, and the image folder should now contain a `CollectedData_<ScorerName>.h5` file.\n    (Note: For convenience, a CSV file with the same name is also saved.)\n\n2. **Resuming labeling** \u2013 the image folder contains a `CollectedData_<ScorerName>.h5` file.\n\n    Open *napari* and open an image folder (which needs to contain a `CollectedData_<ScorerName>.h5` file).\n    In this case, it is not necessary to open the DLC project's `config.yaml` file, as all necessary metadata is read from the `h5` data file.\n\n    Saving works as described in *1*.\n\n    ***Note that if a new body part has been added to the `config.yaml` file after having started to label, loading the config in the GUI is necessary to update the dropdown menus and other metadata.***\n\n3. **Refining labels** \u2013 the image folder contains a `machinelabels-iter<#>.h5` file.\n\n    The process is analog to *2*.\n\n4. **Drawing segmentation masks**\n\n    Drop an image folder as in *1*, manually add a *shapes layer*. Then select the *rectangle* in the layer controls (top left pane),\n    and start drawing rectangles over the images. Masks and rectangle vertices are saved as described in [Save Layers](#save-layers).\n    Note that masks can be reloaded and edited at a later stage by dropping the `vertices.csv` file onto the canvas.\n\n\n### Labeling multiple image folders\n\nLabeling multiple image folders has to be done in sequence; i.e., only one image folder can be opened at a time.\nAfter labeling the images of a particular folder is done and the associated *Points layer* has been saved, *all* layers should be removed from the layers list (lower left pane on the GUI) by selecting them and clicking on the trashcan icon.\nNow, another image folder can be labeled, following the process described in *1*, *2*, or *3*, depending on the particular image folder.\n\n\n### Defining cropping coordinates\n\nPrior to defining cropping coordinates, two elements should be loaded in the GUI:\na video and the DLC project's `config.yaml` file (into which the crop dimensions will be stored).\nThen it suffices to add a `Shapes layer`, draw a `rectangle` in it with the desired area,\nand hit the button `Store crop coordinates`; coordinates are automatically written to the configuration file.\n\n\n## Contributing\n\nContributions are very welcome.
