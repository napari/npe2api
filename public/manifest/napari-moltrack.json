Includes tools for editing/modifying segmentations at a sub-pixel resolution.\n\nCompatible with both single and multi-channel .tif and .fits files.\n\nnapari-moltrack was written by Piers Turner, Kapanidis Group, University of Oxford.\n\nhttps://www.physics.ox.ac.uk/research/group/gene-machines\n\n----------------------------------\n\nThis [napari] plugin was generated with [Cookiecutter] using [@napari]'s [cookiecutter-napari-plugin] template.\n\n<!--\nDon't miss the full getting started guide to set up your new package:\nhttps://github.com/napari/cookiecutter-napari-plugin#getting-started\n\nand review the napari docs for plugin developers:\nhttps://napari.org/stable/plugins/index.html\n-->\n\n## Installation\n\nYou can install `napari-moltrack` via [pip]:\n\n    pip install napari-moltrack\n\nTo update `napari-moltrack` to the latest version, use:\n\n    pip install napari-moltrack --upgrade\n\nTo install latest development version :\n\n    pip install git+https://github.com/piedrro/napari-moltrack.git\n\n\n## BactFit\n\nnapari-moltrack integrates BactFit, a package for fitting the shape of rod shaped bacterial cells to an ideal cell model.\nBactFit allows cell renders and heatmaps to be generated through the transformation of SMLM localisations to an ideal cell model.\n\n### BactFit Heatmap\n\n![Feature Image](resources/heatmap.png)\n\n### BactFit Cell Render\n\n![Feature Image](resources/render.png)\n\n\n## Contributing\n\nContributions are very welcome.
