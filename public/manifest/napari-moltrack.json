This plugin was designed to detect/track single molecules inside cells, but can be used for any other SMLM/tracking application.\n\nAll functions are parallelised/GPU accelerated where possible to increase performance. Multiple files can  be loaded and processed in parallel.\n\nSingle molecule localisations can be filtered by their properties (e.g. photons, width, etc.) and can be rendered as a super resolution image.\n\nSegmentations can be used to exlude regions from single molecule localisaton and tracking. Segmentations can be added automatically using Cellpose or can be added manually. Includes tools for editing/modifying segmentations at a sub-pixel resolution.\n\nCompatible with single channel .tif and .fits files only.\n\nnapari-moltrack was written by Piers Turner, Kapanidis Group, University of Oxford.\n\nhttps://www.physics.ox.ac.uk/research/group/gene-machines\n\n----------------------------------\n\nThis [napari] plugin was generated with [Cookiecutter] using [@napari]'s [cookiecutter-napari-plugin] template.\n\n<!--\nDon't miss the full getting started guide to set up your new package:\nhttps://github.com/napari/cookiecutter-napari-plugin#getting-started\n\nand review the napari docs for plugin developers:\nhttps://napari.org/stable/plugins/index.html\n-->\n\n## Installation\n\nYou can install `napari-moltrack` via [pip]:\n\n    pip install napari-moltrack\n\n\n\nTo install latest development version :\n\n    pip install git+https://github.com/piedrro/napari-moltrack.git\n\n\n## Contributing\n\nContributions are very welcome.
