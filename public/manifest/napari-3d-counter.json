First launch napari with the `napari` command.\n1. Count3D can be launched from the plugin menu of napari, or through the\n   command palette (Ctrl+Shift+P). Select Count3D.\n\nThis will spawn several [Points Layers](https://napari.org/stable/howtos/layers/points.html):\n\n##### Point adder\n\nThis layer acts as the interface for napari-3d-counter. Any points added to\nthis layer are dispatched into the appropriate data layer labeled by the GUI.\n*Any other actions to this layer has no effects*\n\n##### Cell Type N\n\nThese are the data layers. The points actually live in these layers,\nand you can edit the style or delete individual points here.\n\n##### out of slice\n\nThis contains the x and y of all points in all layers. This may be\nuseful to keep track of what regions of the data have been annotated.\n\n### Adding a cell\n\nYou can add a cell of the currently selected cell type by clicking on the\nviewer. The counter on the current cell type's button (on the right side of the\nscreen) will be incremented.\n\n<details>\n\n<summary>Troubleshooting</summary>\n\n- Ensure that `Point adder` layer is selected\n- Ensure that `Add points` tool is selected\n- Click on the viewer where you would like the point to be added\n\n</details>\n\n\nhttps://github.com/pnewstein/napari-3d-counter/assets/30813691/745d495e-1d18-43dd-aa5e-e9ecd835cdae\n\n\n### Changing cell type\n\nYou can change the currently selected cell type by clicking on that cell type's\nbutton. This change will be reflected in the GUI. Additionally, the keyboard\nshortcut for that cell type can be used. Keyboard shortcuts are listed on the\nbutton, and are \"q\", \"w\", \"e\", \"r\", \"t\", \"y\" by default\n\n\nhttps://github.com/pnewstein/napari-3d-counter/assets/30813691/844d04ce-2795-4226-a98b-d5fe5a0b131e\n\n\n### Undo last added cell\n\nThe undo button (shortcut u) will remove last added cell, regardless of\ncell type\n\n\nhttps://github.com/pnewstein/napari-3d-counter/assets/30813691/c04ca5e3-9f48-4dd5-89e5-a9866b353e03\n\n\n### Remove a particular cell\n\nTo remove a particular cell, change to the layer containing the cell you would\nlike to remove. Then select the `select points` tool to select the points to\ndelete, then use `Delete selected points` to delete those points\n\nThis change will be reflected in the counts.\n\n> *Important*\n> Ensure that the corect napari cell type layer is selected\n\n\nhttps://github.com/pnewstein/napari-3d-counter/assets/30813691/d0787cba-9b23-46d5-9cd3-21a4ad73460a\n\n\n\n### Change appearance of a cell type\n\nChanges to the name or edge color of a points layer will be reflected in the\npreviously added points, as well as the GUI. Features that are editable in this way include:\n    - face color\n    - edge color\n    - symbol\n    - size\n\n> *Important*\n> Ensure that the corect napari cell type layer is selected\n\nhttps://github.com/pnewstein/napari-3d-counter/assets/30813691/6c495270-d4c4-473e-9091-8d2e0f8e2764\n\n\n### Save configuration\n\nUse the `Make launch_cell_count.py` button to create a python script that will\nlaunch napari with 3DCounter added to the dock and current cell type appearances\nalready loaded\n\n\nhttps://github.com/pnewstein/napari-3d-counter/assets/30813691/3448652d-3064-4900-8bbe-e88d75667108\n\n\n### Save cells\n\nUse the \"Save cells\" button to save the cell coordinates for all layers into a\ncsv file\n\n\nhttps://github.com/pnewstein/napari-3d-counter/assets/30813691/38b30f2a-cc83-46c2-8b19-4d44715c07c5\n\n\n### Load cells\n\nUse the \"Load cells\" button to load the cells from a csv file into new layers\n\n\nhttps://github.com/pnewstein/napari-3d-counter/assets/30813691/7df74688-85b1-4b61-aa51-dab179763832\n\n\n### Launch with saved configuration\n\nTo run Count3D with custom configuration, paste the following code into your napari ipython console\n\n```python\nfrom napari_3d_counter import Count3D, CellTypeConfig\n\ncell_type_config = [\n    # The first cell type is called \"cq+eve+\" and should be green\n    CellTypeConfig(\n        name=\"cq+eve+\",\n        color=\"g\"\n    ),\n    # The first cell type is called \"cq+eve-\" and should be cyan\n    CellTypeConfig(\n        name=\"cq+eve-\",\n        color=\"c\"\n    ),\n    # The first cell type is called \"cq-eve+\" and should be red\n    CellTypeConfig(\n        name=\"cq-eve+\",\n        color=\"r\"\n    ),\n]\n# Launch the plugin with configuration\nviewer.window.add_dock_widget(Count3D(viewer, cell_type_config=cell_type_config))\n```\n\n##  Auxiliary plugins\n\n\n### Ingress Points\n\n![Ingress Points](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/2b0dc92b-ae14-40e0-8670-0d99f36b3468)\n\nThis plugin takes a points layer and adds the points to the selected cell type\nlayer. This can be useful if you want to manually count cells after cell identification.\n\n### Split on Shapes\n\n![Split on Shapes](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/0d3c12fc-1347-4226-a9b9-9e34dd50577a)\n\nThis plugin can be used to subset a cell type into several groups based on their\nx-y location. Simply draw a shape that surrounds your cells (perhaps in a\nsegment) and run this plugin to get a list of cells of each type in each shape.\n\n### Reconstruct Selected\n\n![Reconstruct Selected](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/2f629b5a-d976-4add-8c5b-af4fc7e45729)\n\nOne use case of Napari 3D Counter is to visualize a subset of labeled cells.\nFor example, automated process label your cells of interest as well as a set of\noff-target cells, and you would like to visualize only your cells of interest.\nThis can be accomplished by using Napari 3D Counter to count your cells of\ninterest, and some other process to create labels (perhaps\n[nsbatwm](https://github.com/haesleinhuepf/napari-segment-blobs-and-things-with-membranes))\nand using Reconstruct Selected to create a new image layer of those labels\nwhich have been counted as a particular cell type.\n\n## Contributing\n\nContributions are very welcome.
