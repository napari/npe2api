Users can provide input and make corrections through point clicks or manually drawn masks.\n\nThe tool leverages the [SAM2Long](https://github.com/Mark12Ding/SAM2Long) model, an optimized version of [Meta's SAM 2](https://github.com/facebookresearch/sam2) with enhancements to the memory module for improved performance on long videos. It was built to support long videos, but it remains effective for shorter videos as well.\n\nThis [napari] plugin was generated with [copier] using the [napari-plugin-template].\n\n<!--\nDon't miss the full getting started guide to set up your new package:\nhttps://github.com/napari/napari-plugin-template#getting-started\n\nand review the napari docs for plugin developers:\nhttps://napari.org/stable/plugins/index.html\n-->\n\n## Installation\nPlease see the official [SAM 2](https://github.com/facebookresearch/sam2) repo and the [INSTALL.md](https://github.com/facebookresearch/sam2/blob/main/INSTALL.md) for notes and FAQs on potential installation issues.\n\n1. Create a new conda environment with python>=3.10 and install napari:\n    ```bash\n    conda create -n napari-sam2long python==3.10\n    conda activate napari-sam2long\n    python -m pip install \"napari[all]\"\n    ```\n\n2. Install PyTorch and TorchVision. Select preferences [here](https://pytorch.org/get-started/locally/) to find correct installation command.\n\n    Example command can look like this:\n\n    ```bash\n    pip3 install torch torchvision torchaudio --index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cu126\n    ```\n\n3. Install SAM2Long:\n    ```bash\n    git clone git@github.com:maihanhoang/napari-sam2long.git\n\n    cd napari-sam2long/SAM2Long && pip install -e .\n    ```\n4. Install napari-SAM2Long plugin:\n    ```bash\n    cd .. && pip install e .\n    ```\n\n## Usage\n\n### Segmenting & tracking first object\n1. Open a 3D tiff in napari, make sure it is in TYX or ZYX format\n2. Select the image in the drop-down menu of *Input*\n3. Add a new [labels layer](https://napari.org/0.5.0/howtos/layers/labels.html) to the viewer and select it in the drop-down menu of *Labels*\n    Note: The labels layer should always be added to the viewer after the input image to match the dimensions.\n4. Select the *Model*\n5. Click *Initialize* to load the image and initialize the inference state\n6. Select an object on any frame and get an initial mask with\n    - the *mouse middle click* to get the model's mask prediction\n        (*mouse middle click* to add and *Ctrl+mouse middle click* to remove areas) and/or\n    - napari's [labels layers tools](https://napari.org/0.5.0/howtos/layers/labels.html#gui-tools-for-the-labels-layer) (e.g. paintbrush, eraser etc.) to manually draw a mask\n\n    Note: When the model fails to segment the desired object with the point prompts using *(Ctrl+) mouse middle click*, manually drawing/correcting the mask with napari's labels layer tools can be very useful\n\n7. Once satisfied with the initial mask, click *Propagate from current frame* to obtain segmentations for all subsequent frames. The result will be added to the labels layer.\n\n    Note: *Propagate from current frame* computes the masklets only for the subsequent frames to reduce computation time and does not affect any masklets of the previous frames. Only the mask of the current frame propagation is started from is considered in the prediction, any prompts made in previous and subsequent frames are not regarded.\n\n### Making corrections\n8. Re-draw a new mask on any frame by using the *(Ctrl+) mouse middle click* to (remove) add regions and/or napari's labels layers tools.\n9. *Propagate from current frame* to re-run the model's predictions with the new mask\n\nNote: When making corrections and \"re-defining\" the masks, this plugin treats the corrected mask as a new initial mask and disregards any previous prompts on this frame.\n\n### Segmenting another object in the same image/video\n10. Save labels layer with the segmentation result of previous object\n11. Click *Reset* or add another labels layer to the viewer and select the new layer in the *Labels*-dropdown. Select new object as described in step 6.\n\n###  Segment new image/video\n12. *Reset* inference state\n13. Load new image/video and follow instructions from step 1. *Initialize* is necessary to load the new image/video.\n\n## Contributing\n\nContributions are very welcome.

Downstream recipients.\n\n            a. Offer from the Licensor -- Licensed Material. Every\n               recipient of the Licensed Material automatically\n               receives an offer from the Licensor to exercise the\n               Licensed Rights under the terms and conditions of this\n               Public License.\n\n            b. No downstream restrictions. You may not offer or impose\n               any additional or different terms or conditions on, or\n               apply any Effective Technological Measures to, the\n               Licensed Material if doing so restricts exercise of the\n               Licensed Rights by any recipient of the Licensed\n               Material.\n\n       6. No endorsement. Nothing in this Public License constitutes or\n          may be construed as permission to assert or imply that You\n          are, or that Your use of the Licensed Material is, connected\n          with, or sponsored, endorsed, or granted official status by,\n          the Licensor or others designated to receive attribution as\n          provided in Section 3(a)(1)(A)(i).\n\n  b. Other rights.\n\n       1. Moral rights, such as the right of integrity, are not\n          licensed under this Public License, nor are publicity,\n          privacy, and/or other similar personality rights; however, to\n          the extent possible, the Licensor waives and/or agrees not to\n          assert any such rights held by the Licensor to the limited\n          extent necessary to allow You to exercise the Licensed\n          Rights, but not otherwise.\n\n       2. Patent and trademark rights are not licensed under this\n          Public License.\n\n       3. To the extent possible, the Licensor waives any right to\n          collect royalties from You for the exercise of the Licensed\n          Rights, whether directly or through a collecting society\n          under any voluntary or waivable statutory or compulsory\n          licensing scheme. In all other cases the Licensor expressly\n          reserves any right to collect such royalties, including when\n          the Licensed Material is used other than for NonCommercial\n          purposes.\n\nSection 3 -- License Conditions.\n\nYour exercise of the Licensed Rights is expressly made subject to the\nfollowing conditions.\n\n  a. Attribution.\n\n       1. If You Share the Licensed Material (including in modified\n          form), You must:\n\n            a. retain the following if it is supplied by the Licensor\n               with the Licensed Material:\n\n                 i. identification of the creator(s) of the Licensed\n                    Material and any others designated to receive\n                    attribution, in any reasonable manner requested by\n                    the Licensor (including by pseudonym if\n                    designated);\n\n                ii. a copyright notice;\n\n               iii. a notice that refers to this Public License;\n\n                iv. a notice that refers to the disclaimer of\n                    warranties;\n\n                 v. a URI or hyperlink to the Licensed Material to the\n                    extent reasonably practicable;\n\n            b. indicate if You modified the Licensed Material and\n               retain an indication of any previous modifications; and\n\n            c. indicate the Licensed Material is licensed under this\n               Public License, and include the text of, or the URI or\n               hyperlink to, this Public License.\n\n       2. You may satisfy the conditions in Section 3(a)(1) in any\n          reasonable manner based on the medium, means, and context in\n          which You Share the Licensed Material. For example, it may be\n          reasonable to satisfy the conditions by providing a URI or\n          hyperlink to a resource that includes the required\n          information.\n\n       3. If requested by the Licensor, You must remove any of the\n          information required by Section 3(a)(1)(A) to the extent\n          reasonably practicable.\n\n       4. If You Share Adapted Material You produce, the Adapter's\n          License You apply must not prevent recipients of the Adapted\n          Material from complying with this Public License.\n\nSection 4 -- Sui Generis Database Rights.\n\nWhere the Licensed Rights include Sui Generis Database Rights that\napply to Your use of the Licensed Material:\n\n  a. for the avoidance of doubt, Section 2(a)(1) grants You the right\n     to extract, reuse, reproduce, and Share all or a substantial\n     portion of the contents of the database for NonCommercial purposes\n     only;\n\n  b. if You include all or a substantial portion of the database\n     contents in a database in which You have Sui Generis Database\n     Rights, then the database in which You have Sui Generis Database\n     Rights (but not its individual contents) is Adapted Material; and\n\n  c. You must comply with the conditions in Section 3(a) if You Share\n     all or a substantial portion of the contents of the database.\n\nFor the avoidance of doubt, this Section 4 supplements and does not\nreplace Your obligations under this Public License where the Licensed\nRights include other Copyright and Similar Rights.\n\nSection 5 -- Disclaimer of Warranties and Limitation of Liability.\n\n  a. UNLESS OTHERWISE SEPARATELY UNDERTAKEN BY THE LICENSOR, TO THE\n     EXTENT POSSIBLE, THE LICENSOR OFFERS THE LICENSED MATERIAL AS-IS\n     AND AS-AVAILABLE, AND MAKES NO REPRESENTATIONS OR WARRANTIES OF\n     ANY KIND CONCERNING THE LICENSED MATERIAL, WHETHER EXPRESS,\n     IMPLIED, STATUTORY, OR OTHER.

The disclaimer of warranties and limitation of liability provided\n     above shall be interpreted in a manner that, to the extent\n     possible, most closely approximates an absolute disclaimer and\n     waiver of all liability.\n\nSection 6 -- Term and Termination.\n\n  a. This Public License applies for the term of the Copyright and\n     Similar Rights licensed here. However, if You fail to comply with\n     this Public License, then Your rights under this Public License\n     terminate automatically.\n\n  b. Where Your right to use the Licensed Material has terminated under\n     Section 6(a), it reinstates:\n\n       1. automatically as of the date the violation is cured, provided\n          it is cured within 30 days of Your discovery of the\n          violation; or\n\n       2. upon express reinstatement by the Licensor.\n\n     For the avoidance of doubt, this Section 6(b) does not affect any\n     right the Licensor may have to seek remedies for Your violations\n     of this Public License.\n\n  c. For the avoidance of doubt, the Licensor may also offer the\n     Licensed Material under separate terms or conditions or stop\n     distributing the Licensed Material at any time; however, doing so\n     will not terminate this Public License.\n\n  d. Sections 1, 5, 6, 7, and 8 survive termination of this Public\n     License.\n\nSection 7 -- Other Terms and Conditions.\n\n  a. The Licensor shall not be bound by any additional or different\n     terms or conditions communicated by You unless expressly agreed.\n\n  b. Any arrangements, understandings, or agreements regarding the\n     Licensed Material not stated herein are separate from and\n     independent of the terms and conditions of this Public License.\n\nSection 8 -- Interpretation.\n\n  a. For the avoidance of doubt, this Public License does not, and\n     shall not be interpreted to, reduce, limit, restrict, or impose\n     conditions on any use of the Licensed Material that could lawfully\n     be made without permission under this Public License.\n\n  b. To the extent possible, if any provision of this Public License is\n     deemed unenforceable, it shall be automatically reformed to the\n     minimum extent necessary to make it enforceable. If the provision\n     cannot be reformed, it shall be severed from this Public License\n     without affecting the enforceability of the remaining terms and\n     conditions.\n\n  c. No term or condition of this Public License will be waived and no\n     failure to comply consented to unless expressly agreed to by the\n     Licensor.\n\n  d. Nothing in this Public License constitutes or may be interpreted\n     as a limitation upon, or waiver of, any privileges and immunities\n     that apply to the Licensor or You, including from the legal\n     processes of any jurisdiction or authority.\n\n=======================================================================\n\nCreative Commons is not a party to its public\nlicenses.
