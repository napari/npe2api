This factor is typically more than 1.0 because the z dimension is often undersampled)\n\t- Ideally min scales and max scales should be estimated from your data (`min_scale` should be set as `min_radius/sqrt(3)` and `max_scale` should be set as `max_radius/sqrt(3)`. The default values of `min_scale=5` and `max_scale=9` generally works well).  \n\t- Click `Run Scale Space Log` button. Please note that this step takes a few minutes.\n\t- Wait until a confirmation message suggesting that nuclei detection is over shows up on the terminal\n\t- Export the nuclei locations (`Export detections to csv`) to a csv file\n\t- Repeat this step for all images which need to be matched\n\n\n\n\nhttps://user-images.githubusercontent.com/34229641/120660618-cd5d3980-c487-11eb-8996-326264a4df87.mp4\n\n\n- **Estimate Transform**\n\t- In case, nuclei were exported to a csv in the `Detect Nuclei` panel, tick `csv` checkbox\n\t- If the nuclei detected were specified in the order id, z, y and x in the csv file, then tick `IZYXR` checkbox\n\t- Additionally if there is a header in the csv file, tick `Header` checkbox\n\t- Load the detections for the `Moving Image`, which is defined as the image which will be transformed to later match another `fixed` image\n\t- Load the detections for the `Fixed Image`\n\t- Click on `Run` pushbutton. Once the calculation is complete, a confirmation message shows up in the terminal. Export the transform matrix to a csv (Note that this step can take a few minutes)\n\t- It is also possible to estimate the transform in a `supervised` fashion. For this, upload the locations of a few matching keypoints in both images. These locations serve to provide a good starting point for the transform calculation. Once the keypoint files have been uploaded for both the images, then click `Run` and then export the transform matrix to a csv file \n\n\nhttps://user-images.githubusercontent.com/34229641/120685628-53857a00-c4a0-11eb-8f92-7ffac730e28a.mp4\n\n\n\n- **Evaluate Metrics**\n\t- Drag images which need to be transformed, in the viewer\n\t- Click on `Sync with Viewer` button to refresh the drop-down menus\n\t- Specify the anisotropy factor (`Moving Image Anisotropy (Z)` and `Fixed Image Anisotropy (Z)`) (i.e. the ratio of the size of the z pixel with respect to the x or y pixel. This factor is typically more than 1.0 because the z dimension is often undersampled)\n\t- Load the transform which was calculated in the previous steps\n\t- If you simply wish to export a transformed version of the moving image, click on `Export Transformed Image`\n\t- Additionally, one could quantify metrics such as average registration error evaluated on a few keypoints. To do so, tick the `csv` checkbox, if keypoints and detections are available as a csv file. Then load the keypoints for the moving image (`Moving Kepoints`) and the fixed image (`Fixed Keypoints`)\n\t- Also, upload the detections calculated in the previous steps (`Detect Nuclei`)  by uploading the `Moving Detections` and the `Fixed Detections`\n\t- Click on the `Run` push button\n\t- The text fields such as `Matching Accuracy`(0 to 1, with 1 being the best) and `Average Registration Error` (the lower the better) should become populated once the results are available\n\n\n\nhttps://user-images.githubusercontent.com/34229641/120685654-5b451e80-c4a0-11eb-8d7d-de58b8b8304d.mp4\n\n\n### Contributing\n\nContributions are very welcome.
