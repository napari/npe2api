Via a common API (Application Programming Interface),\nit possible to define a controller for a specific camera. Instructions\non how to do so are provided in the documentation.\n\nBy default, the plugin is shipped with the following interfaces:\n\n- an [OpenCV](./src/napari_live_recording/control/devices/opencv.py) camera grabber;\n- a [Micro-Manager](./src/napari_live_recording/control/devices/micro_manager.py) interface via the package [`pymmcore-plus`](https://pypi.org/project/pymmcore-plus/);\n- an interface to the [microscope](./src/napari_live_recording/control/devices/pymicroscope.py) python package.\n\n## Documentation\n\nTo install and use the plugin you can review the documentation [here](./docs/documentation.md).\n\n## Contributing\n\nContributions are very welcome. Tests can be run with [tox], please ensure\nthe coverage at least stays the same before you submit a pull request.\n\n## Acknowledgments\n\nThe developers would like to thank the [Chan-Zuckerberg Initiative (CZI)](https://chanzuckerberg.com/) for providing funding\nfor this project via the [napari Ecosystem Grants](https://chanzuckerberg.com/science/programs-resources/imaging/napari/napari-live-recording-camera-control-through-napari/).\n\n<p align=\"center\">\n  <img src=\"https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/63a48a2d279afe2a328b2823/5830fddc-a02b-451a-827b-3d4446dcf57b/Chan_Zuckerberg_Initiative.png\" width=\"150\">\n</p>\n\n## License\n\nDistributed under the terms of the [MIT] license,\n\"napari-live-recording\" is free and open source software\n\n## Issues\n\nIf you encounter any problems, please [file an issue] along with a detailed description.\n\n[napari]: https://github.com/napari/napari\n[Cookiecutter]: https://github.com/audreyr/cookiecutter\n[@napari]: https://github.com/napari\n[MIT]: http://opensource.org/licenses/MIT\n[BSD-3]: http://opensource.org/licenses/BSD-3-Clause\n[GNU GPL v3.0]: http://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-3.0.txt\n[GNU LGPL v3.0]: http://www.gnu.org/licenses/lgpl-3.0.txt\n[Apache Software License 2.0]: http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0\n[Mozilla Public License 2.0]: https://www.mozilla.org/media/MPL/2.0/index.txt\n[cookiecutter-napari-plugin]: https://github.com/napari/cookiecutter-napari-plugin\n\n[file an issue]: https://github.com/jacopoabramo/napari-live-recording/issues\n\n[napari]: https://github.com/napari/napari\n[tox]: https://tox.readthedocs.io/en/latest/\n[pip]: https://pypi.org/project/pip/\n[PyPI]: https://pypi.org/\n",
