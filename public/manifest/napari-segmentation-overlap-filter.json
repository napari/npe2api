Download the example dataset images\n2. Start napari and open both images as separate layers\n3. Convert the layers from an `Image Layer` to a `Labels Layer` by right-clicking on the layer\n4. Open the plugin with `Plugins > Segmentation Overlap Filter` and the widget will appear on the right\n5. Select the two segmentation masks you'd like to combine using the drop down and menu\n6. Drag the slider to set percent overlap allowed\n7. Click `Run`\n8. Optionally, export the overlap dataframe as a csv file\n\n### Python API\nThis [example notebook] shows how you can integrate the Python API into your own workflow for filtering and combining overlapping segmentation masks\n\n## Issues\n\nIf you encounter any problems, please file an issue along with a detailed description.\n\n[napari]: https://github.com/napari/napari\n[Cookiecutter]: https://github.com/audreyr/cookiecutter\n[@napari]: https://github.com/napari\n[Dask]: https://www.dask.org/\n[pip]: https://pypi.org/project/pip/\n[example notebook]: https://github.com/FrancisCrickInstitute/PARSEG/blob/main/Notebooks/Combine_Segmentations_And_Filter_Overlaps.ipynb\n",
