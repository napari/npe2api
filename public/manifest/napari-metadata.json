As such, it is not widely distributed and you should not expect support or future maintenance.\n\nThis plugin lacks a public API by design. In particular, you should not rely on any of the extra keys or values in `Layer.metadata` in your own software of napari plugins. They are purely implementation details of this plugin.\n\nYou can of course feel free to use the plugin or any of its code, but by doing so accept ownership of any issues that arise. If you have ideas or comments about this work, feel free to [file an issue].\n\n## Installation\n\nYou can install the latest development version of `napari-metadata` via [pip]:\n\n    pip install git+https://github.com/andy-sweet/napari-metadata.git\n\nAlternatively, fork or clone this repository directly and install in editable mode for development:\n\n    pip install -e . --group dev\n\n## Findings\n\nSince this plugin is an experiment, we performed some [initial testing](https://github.com/andy-sweet/napari-metadata/blob/main/docs/testing-2023-05.md) to assess its value.\nOverall sentiment was positive, though there were some suggestions and points of discussion that could be useful for related and future work.\n\nWe also received some feedback on [the zulip topic where this plugin was announced](https://napari.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/309872-plugins/topic/WIP.20metadata.20plugin), which may be useful to reference.\n\n## Contributing\n\nSince this is still experimental, I don't encourage contributions and likely won't review PRs with much urgency.\n\n## License\n\nDistributed under the terms of the [BSD-3] license,\n\"napari-metadata\" is free and open source software\n\n[napari]: https://github.com/napari/napari\n[BSD-3]: http://opensource.org/licenses/BSD-3-Clause\n[file an issue]: https://github.com/andy-sweet/napari-metadata/issues\n[pip]: https://pypi.org/project/pip\n",
