It uses RGB images to perform inference and allows users to manually refine the generated mask.\n\n----------------------------------\n\nThe method was developped by Herearii Metuarea, PHENET PhD at LARIS (French laboratory located in Angers, France) and Abdoul Djalil Ousseini Hamza, AgroEcoPhen Engineer at IRHS (French Institute located in INRAe Angers, France) in Imhorphen team (bioimaging research group lead) under the supervision of Eric Duch\u00eane (Research Engineer), Morgane Roth (Research Engineer) and David Rousseau (Full professor). This plugin was written by Herearii Metuarea and was designed in the context of the european project PHENET.\n\n![Data Warehouse](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/4a110408-5854-4e8c-b655-4cb588434b79)\n\n\n----------------------------------\n\nThis [napari] plugin was generated with [copier] using the [napari-plugin-template].\n\n<!--\nDon't miss the full getting started guide to set up your new package:\nhttps://github.com/napari/napari-plugin-template#getting-started\n\nand review the napari docs for plugin developers:\nhttps://napari.org/stable/plugins/index.html\n-->\n\n## Installation\n\nYou can install `frontveg` via [pip]:\n\n    pip install frontveg\n\n\n\nTo install latest development version :\n\n    pip install git+https://github.com/hereariim/frontveg.git\n\n## Description\n\nThis plugin is a tool to perform image inference. This plugin contained two steps of image processing. First, from RGB image, a depth map is estimated and then thresholded based on the estimated depth histogram modes to detect foreground and background regions in image. Second, a Grounding DINO model detects foliage in the foreground. The output is a binary mask where white colour are associated to foliage in the foreground.\n\nThe plugin is applicable to images of trellised plants; in this configuration, it has been applied to images of pome fruit trees (apple), stone fruit trees (apricot) and climbing plants (grapevine).\n\n![sample_example](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ae845e01-9f48-4bcf-98ad-bf5f6e037f01)\n\n## Contact\n\nImhorphen team, bioimaging research group\n\n42 rue George Morel, Angers, France\n\n- Pr David Rousseau, david.rousseau@univ-angers.fr\n- Abdoul Djalil Ousseini Hamza, abdoul-djalil.ousseini-hamza@inrae.fr\n- Herearii Metuarea, herearii.metuarea@univ-angers.fr\n\n## Contributing\n\nContributions are very welcome.
