This has mainly two advantages when visualizing in 3D:\n\n1. We don't have to load the whole data into memory\n2. The surrounding objects won't occlude the annotated ones, making it easier to check the annotation.\n\nBounding boxes can be created from the `Object list` widget. The dimensionality of the bounding box layer will be determined from the image layer. As bounding boxes are created, a small thumbnail will be displayed.\n\nThe proposed pipeline goes as follows:\n\n 1. Create a bounding box layer\n 2. Select data parts using the bounding boxes\n 3. Select an object from the object list\n 4. Annotate the object\n 5. Repeat from 3.\n\n### Slice interpolation\nThe `Interpolation` tab contains tools for estimating missing annotation slices from existing ones. There are multiple options:\n * Geometric: the interpolation will be determined by calculating the average of the corresponding contour points.\n * RPSV: A more sophisticated average contour calculation, see the preprint [here](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1901.02823.pdf).\n * Distance-based: a signed distance transform is applied to the annotations. The missing slices will be filled in using their \nweighted sum.\n\n> **Note**: Geometric and RPSV interpolation works only when there's a single connected mask on each slice. If you want to \n> interpolate disjoint objects (*e.g.* dividing cells), use distance based interpolation instead.\n\n> **Note**: Distance-based interpolation might give bad results if some masks are too far away from each other on the same slice\n> and there's a big offset compared to the other slice used in the interpolation. If you get unsatisfactory results, try\n> annotating more slices (skip less frames).\n\nhttps://user-images.githubusercontent.com/36735863/188876826-1771acee-93ba-4905-982e-bfb459329659.mp4\n\n### Minimal contour\nThis plugin can estimate a minimal contour, which is calculated from a point set on the edges of the object, which are provided by the user. This contour will follow some kind of image feature (pixels with high gradient or high/low intensity).\nFeatures:\n * With a single click a new point can be added to the set. This will also extend the contour with the curve shown in red\n * A double click will close the curve by adding both the red and gray curves to the minimal contour\n * When holding `Shift`, the gray and red highlight will be swapped, so the other curve can be added to the contour\n * With the `Ctrl` button down a straight line can be added instead of the minimal path\n * If the anchor points were misplaced, the last point can be removed by right-clicking, or the whole point set can be cleared by pressing `Esc`\n * The `Param` value at the widget will decide, how strongly should the contour follow edges on the image. Higher value means higher sensitivity to image data, while a lower value will be closer to straight lines.\n * Different features can be used, like image gradient or pixel intensities, and also user-defined features (using Python)\n   * the image is accessed as the `image` variable, and the features should be stored in the `features` variable in the small code editor widget\n\nThis functionality can be used by selecting the `Minimal Contour` tab in the `Annotation Toolbox` widget, which will create a new layer called `Anchors`.\n\n> **Warning**: Do not remove the `Anchors` layer!\n\n> **Warning**: Some utility layers appear in the layer list when using the plugin. These are marked with a lock (:lock:) symbol.\n> __Do not remove them or modify their data, as this will most probably break the plugin!__ However, you can change their appearance,\n> *e.g.* their color settings.\n\n#### Intensity-based:\n\nhttps://user-images.githubusercontent.com/36735863/191023482-0dfafb5c-003a-47f6-a21b-8582a4e3930f.mp4\n\n#### Gradient-based:\n\nhttps://user-images.githubusercontent.com/36735863/191024941-f20f63a0-8281-47d2-be22-d1ec34fe1f5d.mp4\n\n#### Custom feature:\n\nhttps://user-images.githubusercontent.com/36735863/191025028-3f807bd2-1f2e-40d2-800b-48af820a7dbe.mp4\n\n### Shortcuts\n\n| Action                                        | Mouse               | Keyboard       |\n|-----------------------------------------------|---------------------|----------------|\n| Increment selected label                      | `Shift + Wheel \u2b06\ufe0f`  | `E`            |\n| Decrement selected label                      | `Shift + Wheel \u2b07\ufe0f`  | `Q`            |\n| Previous slice                                | `Ctrl + Wheel \u2b06\ufe0f`\\* | `A`            |\n| Next slice                                    | `Ctrl + Wheel \u2b07\ufe0f`\\* | `D`            |\n| Increase paint brush size of labels layer     | `Alt + Wheel \u2b06\ufe0f`    | `W`            |\n| Decrease paint brush size of labels layer     | `Alt + Wheel \u2b07\ufe0f`    | `S`            |\n| Interpolate                                   | -                   | `Ctrl+I`       |\n| Change between 'Anchors' and the labels layer | -                   | `Ctrl+Tab`     |\n| Jump to layer `#i`                            | -                   | `Ctrl+'i'`\\*\\* |\n\n> *Built-in functionality of [napari]\n> \n> **`i`: 0-9\n\n> **Note**: you can check the list of available shortcuts by clicking the `?` button in the bottom right corner of the main widget.\n\n## License\n\nDistributed under the terms of the [BSD-3] license,\n\"napari-nD-annotator\" is free and open source software\n\n## Issues\n\nIf you encounter any problems, please [file an issue] along with a detailed description.\n\n[napari]: https://github.com/napari/napari\n[napari-hub]: https://napari-hub.org/\n[Cookiecutter]: https://github.com/audreyr/cookiecutter\n[@napari]: https://github.com/napari\n[MIT]: http://opensource.org/licenses/MIT\n[BSD-3]: http://opensource.org/licenses/BSD-3-Clause\n[GNU GPL v3.0]: http://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-3.0.txt\n[GNU LGPL v3.0]: http://www.gnu.org/licenses/lgpl-3.0.txt\n[Apache Software License 2.0]: http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0\n[Mozilla Public License 2.0]: https://www.mozilla.org/media/MPL/2.0/index.txt\n[cookiecutter-napari-plugin]: https://github.com/napari/cookiecutter-napari-plugin\n\n[tox]: https://tox.readthedocs.io/en/latest/\n[pip]: https://pypi.org/project/pip/\n[PyPI]: https://pypi.org/\n[plugin installation instructions]: https://napari.org/plugins/find_and_install_plugin.html\n[file an issue]: https://github.com/bauerdavid/napari-nD-annotator/issues/new/choose\n[napari-bbox]: https://github.com/bauerdavid/napari-bbox\n",
