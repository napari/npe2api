    "description": "# qhyccd-capture\n\n## Project Introduction\n\n`qhyccd-capture` is a basic operation library for handling QHYCCD series cameras. This library provides functionalities to interact with QHYCCD cameras, including camera connection, parameter setting, image capture, and display. This project is a [napari] plugin, aimed at simplifying the use of the camera through a graphical user interface.\n\n## Features\n\n- **Camera Connection**: Supports loading the corresponding QHYCCD dynamic link libraries on different operating systems (such as Windows, Linux, macOS) and initializing camera resources.\n- **Parameter Setting**: Provides the functionality to set camera parameters, such as exposure time, gain, offset, USB bandwidth, etc.\n- **Image Capture**: Supports single-frame mode exposure and retrieves image data.\n- **Image Display**: Displays captured images through napari, supports distributed display, single display, and sequence display modes.\n- **Histogram and White Balance**: Provides histogram equalization and white balance adjustment functions.\n- **ROI (Region of Interest)**: Supports creating and applying ROIs to operate on specific areas.\n- **Video Recording**: Supports video recording and saves in various video formats.\n- **Temperature Control**: Supports temperature control and displays temperature.\n- **CFW Control**: Supports CFW control and displays CFW status.\n- **Star Point Resolution**: Supports star point resolution and displays the results.\n\n![qhyccd-capture \u63d2\u4ef6\u754c\u9762\u663e\u793a](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/LiuQiang-AI/qhyccd-capture/main/src/qhyccd_capture/images/image.png)\n\n## Installation\nYou can install via pip:\n\n    pip install qhyccd-capture\n\nTo install the latest development version:\n\n    pip install git+https://github.com/nightliar-L/qhyccd-capture.git\n\n## Dependency Installation\n#### Astrometry.net \nCurrently, astrometry.net only supports the Ubuntu system.\n\n    sudo apt-get install astrometry.net\n    sudo apt-get install astrometry-data-tycho2\n    sudo vim ~/.bashrc\n    # Add the following content\n    export PATH=$PATH:/usr/local/astrometry/bin\n\n## Version Changes\n\n- 2024-10-23 Version 0.0.1 Initial version\n- 2024-10-24 Version 0.0.2 Fixed some issues introduced by the release\n- 2024-10-24 Version 0.0.3 Version changes include modified descriptions and initial configurations\n\n## Contributing\n\nContributions are very welcome. Tests can be run with [tox], please ensure\nthe coverage at least stays the same before you submit a pull request.\n\n## License\n\nDistributed under the terms of the [BSD-3] license,\n\"qhyccd-capture\" is free and open source software\n",
