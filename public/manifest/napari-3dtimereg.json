The plugin will create a folder `aligned` in the folder of your selected movie where the results will be saved.\n\nChoose the color chanel on which to calculate the registration (`reference chanel`). Color chanels are numbered from 0 to nchanels, and you can see their respective number in the layer list on the left panel of Napari. Click on `Update` when the correct chanel is selected to go to the registration calculation step.\n\n### Calculate alignement\n\nIf the `reference frame` parameter is set to `previous`, the registration of each frame will be calculated by comparing it to its previous frame (previously aligned). You can also choose to calculate the alignement of all frames compared to the middle (temporally) frame or all frames compared to the first frame of the movie.\n\n![parameters screenshot](./imgs/parameters.png \"Registration parameters\")\n\nThe other parameters are parameters to use [itk-elastix](https://elastix.lumc.nl/) to calculate the registration.\n* `show log`: to see the log of Elastix calculation\n* `do rigid`: performs a rigid (affine) transformation step, that allowed to correct for translations/rotations.\n* `do bspline`: performs a b-spline based transformation step, that allowed for local deformations in the image.\n* `show advanced parameters`: to control the parameters used in the rigid and/or bspline transformations. These parameters control the size of the local registrations calculated, the resolutions at which the transformations are calculated, and can thus greatly impact the results.\n\nIf both rigid and bspline transformations, the program first applies the rigid transformation to allow for a global registration of the images. Then it will performs the second step of b-spline transformation that can includes local deformations.\n\nFor each frame, after calculating the registration on the reference chanel, the plugin will apply the calculated transformation to all the other color chanels of the initial movie. All results are saved as separated images in the `aligned` folder during the computation.\n\n### Create the final aligned movie\n\nWhen all frames have been processed, each color chanel and each frame have been saved in the `aligned` folder as separated images. This is usefull to calculate the registration on large movies without having to keep all the intermediates and calculated images in memory. You can directly use these separated images, or reconstruct a single composite movie of the result.\n\nIf you click on `Concatenate aligned images` on the plugin interface, the plugin will create a single composite movie from the aligned images, save it and delete the separated images in the `aligned` folder. \n\n## License\n\nDistributed under the terms of the [BSD-3] license, \"napari-3dtimereg\" is free and open source software\n\n\n[napari]: https://github.com/napari/napari\n[@napari]: https://github.com/napari\n[BSD-3]: http://opensource.org/licenses/BSD-3-Clause\n[tox]: https://tox.readthedocs.io/en/latest/\n[pip]: https://pypi.org/project/pip/\n[PyPI]: https://pypi.org/\n",
