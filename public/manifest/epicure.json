You can use `pip install -e .` so that everytime you update the code, the plugin will be updated. \n\n## Dependencies\n\nThe input files of EpiCure can be already tracked or not.\nTracking options are proposed in EpiCure:\n* Laptrack centroids\n* Laptrack overlaps\n\n## Usage\nRefer to the [documentation](https://gletort.github.io/Epicure/) for documentation of the different steps possible in the pipeline.\n\n## References\n\nIf you use EpiCure, thank you for citing our work: \n\nEpiCure is not published yet, you can cite it using Zenodo for now: https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.13952184\n\n\n## Issues\nIf you encounter a code related issue using EpiCure, please [file an issue](https://github.com/gletort/epicure/issues) in this repository.\nIf you have a question on using EpiCure or ask to add a feature, either file an issue or write in the [imagesc forum](https://forum.image.sc/).\n\n[napari]: https://github.com/napari/napari\n[file an issue]: https://github.com/gletort/epicure/issues\n[pip]: https://pypi.org/project/pip/\n[PyPI]: https://pypi.org/\n",
