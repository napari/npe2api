This plugin simplifies the application of machine learning in the segmentation process through the 3 main modules:\n  - **Curation**: curate training datasets\n  - **Training**: iteratively train custom segmentation model(s) (UNET) to target cellular structure with wide morphological variability\n  - **Prediction & Thresholding**: generate segmentation prediction on 2D and 3D cell image data\n\n\n##  \ud83d\udcf0 News\n\n - **[2024.09.24]** :tada: Initial release of the plugin and Megaseg models!\n - **[2024.05.29]** :tada: v1.0.0 Released on PyPi\n\n\n## User Documentation\n[See our full user documentation on our github pages site.](https://allencell.github.io/allencell-segmenter-ml/index.html)\n\n\n## \ud83d\udee0\ufe0f Installation\n\n### System and Data Requirements\n\n[Please click here to check out our latest System and Data requirements.](https://allencell.github.io/allencell-segmenter-ml/1_Get-started/1_prerequisites.html)\n\n\n### Installation Steps\n[Please click here for our latest installation steps.](https://allencell.github.io/allencell-segmenter-ml/1_Get-started/2_installation.html)\n\n\n## Models\n[More information about the pre-trained models we provide with our plugin, and citation information, can be found here.](https://allencell.github.io/allencell-segmenter-ml/1_Get-started/4_pretrained-models.html)\n\n## License\n\nDistributed under the terms of the [Allen Institute Software License].\n\n## Issues\n\nIf you encounter any problems, please [file an issue] along with a detailed description.\n\n[napari]: https://github.com/napari/napari\n[@napari]: https://github.com/napari\n[Allen Institute Software License]: https://github.com/AllenCell/allencell-segmenter-ml/blob/main/LICENSE\n[file an issue]: https://github.com/AllenCell/allencell-ml-segmenter/issues\n[napari]: https://github.com/napari/napari\n[tox]: https://tox.readthedocs.io/en/latest/\n[pip]: https://pypi.org/project/pip/\n[PyPI]: https://pypi.org/\n[PyTorch]: https://pytorch.org/get-started/locally/\n",
