In particular this plugin is useful for performing deep learning with a small number of labels and augmentation, and experimenting with different deep learning frameworks.  \n\nImportant note on dependencies:  This plugin is designed to work with different permutations of dependencies.  For example it should work if one of Pytorch, Cellpose, SAM and/or Stardist is installed but does not require all.   Thus we don't specify all the dependencies and leave it up to the user to install the permutation of DL related dependencies they would like to use.  More detailed instructions are below. \n\nIf you have any questions about dependencies splease post on the [Image.sc](Image.sc) forum. \n\n----------------------------------\n\nThis [napari] plugin was generated with [Cookiecutter] using [@napari]'s [cookiecutter-napari-plugin] template.\n\n<!--\nDon't miss the full getting started guide to set up your new package:\nhttps://github.com/napari/cookiecutter-napari-plugin#getting-started\n\nand review the napari docs for plugin developers:\nhttps://napari.org/stable/plugins/index.html\n-->\n\n## Installation\n\nTo install latest development version :\n\n    pip install git+https://github.com/bnorthan/napari-easy-augment-batch-dl.git\n\nYou will also need to install the latest development version of tnia-python:\n\n    pip install git+https://github.com/True-North-Intelligent-Algorithms/tnia-python.git\n\nYou will need to install napari and for augmentation you will need albumentations library.  Also explicitly install numpy 1.26.  (We have not tested with numpy 2.0 so it is a good idea to explicitly install numpy 1.26 to avoid another dependency installing numpy 2.x)\n\n```\n    pip install numpy==1.26\n    pip install napari[all]\n    pip install albumentations\n    pip install matplotlib\n```\n\nYou will also need one or more of stardist, cellpose, segment-everything or Yolo\n\n### Stardist\n\n#### Windows\n\n```\n    conda install -c conda-forge cudatoolkit=11.2 cudnn=8.1.0\n    pip install \"tensorflow<2.11\"\n    pip install stardist==0.8.5\n    pip install gputools\n    pip install edt\n```\n\n#### Linux\n\n```\n    pip install tensorflow[and-cuda]\n    pip install stardist\n    pip install gputools\n    pip install edt\n```\n\n### Pytorch (for unet segmentation)\n\n```\n    pip3 install torch torchvision torchaudio --index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cu118\n    pip install pytorch-lightning\n    pip install monai\n    pip install scipy\n    pip install tifffile\n```\n\n### Cellpose\n\n```\n    pip install cellpose\n```\n\n### SAM (Segment Anything)\n\n```\n    pip install segment-everything\n```\n\n###\n\nYou can install `napari-easy-augment-batch-dl` via [pip]:\n\n    pip install napari-easy-augment-batch-dl\n\n\n## Contributing\n\nContributions are very welcome.
