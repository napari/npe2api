The segmentation results are uploaded as napari layers into the viewer automatically with the name structure of *imgename_prediction*.\n\n## Installation\n\n1. Please install either GPU or CPU version of tensorflow that is compatible with your `cuda` and `cudnn` libraries before installing the plugin depending on your system.\nOne of the plugin dependency is `yapic` that currently has sensitivity to tensorflow versions.\n\n2. You can install `napari-yapic-prediction` via [pip]:\n\n    ```pip install napari-yapic-prediction```\n\n## Contributing\n\nContributions are very welcome.
