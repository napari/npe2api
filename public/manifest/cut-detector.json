Install an [Anaconda] distribution of Python. Note you might need to use an anaconda prompt if you did not add anaconda to the path.\n\n2. Open an Anaconda prompt as admin to create a new environment using [conda]. We advice to use python 3.10 and conda 23.10.0, to get conda-libmamba-solver as default solver.\n\n```\nconda create --name cut_detector python=3.10 conda=23.10.0\nconda activate cut_detector\n```\n\n### Package installation\n\nOnce in a dedicated environment, our package can be installed via [pip]:\n\n```\npip install cut_detector\n```\n\nAlternatively, you can clone the github repo to access to playground scripts.\n\n```\ngit clone https://github.com/15bonte/cut-detector.git\ncd cut-detector\npip install -e .\n```\n\n### GPU\n\nWe highly recommend to use GPU to speed up segmentation. To use your NVIDIA GPU, the first step is to download the dedicated driver from [NVIDIA].\n\nNext we need to remove the CPU version of torch:\n\n```\npip uninstall torch\n```\n\nThe GPU version of torch to be installed can be found [here](https://pytorch.org/get-started/locally/). You may choose the CUDA version supported by your GPU, and install it with conda. This package has been developed with the version 11.6, installed with this command:\n\n```\nconda install pytorch==1.12.1 torchvision pytorch-cuda=11.6 -c pytorch -c nvidia\n```\n\n## Update\n\nTo update cut-detector to the latest version, open an Anaconda prompt and use the following commands:\n\n```\nconda activate cut_detector\npip install cut-detector --upgrade\n```\n\n## Definitions\n\nEach detected cell division is labeled with one of the following categories:\n\n- NORMAL: Division happening as expected, where (at least) 1 micro-tubule cut is detected.\n- NO_MID_BODY_DETECTED: Along the cell division, no mid-body was detected on the MKLP1 channel. This category encompasses different cases: the detection may have failed, the mid-body may not express the fluorescence, or this may not actually be a division.\n- MORE_THAN_TWO_DAUGHTER_TRACKS: Tripolar division. This category encompasses both actual tripolar divisions and wrong identifications of daughter cells (mainly caused by segmentation issues).\n- NEAR_BORDER: Division close to the border of the image, hence ignored as it is likely to be difficult to detect micro-tubule cuts. A division is classified as NEAR_BORDER as soon as the distance between 1 detected mid-body and the border of the image is less than 20px.\n- NO_CUT_DETECTED: Division whose mid-body was detected, but with all micro-tubule bridges classified as \"No cut\". Likely to be at the end of the video, cells dying before the end of division, or cells going out of frame.\n- TOO_SHORT_CUT: First micro-tubule cut detected before or at 50 minutes. Ignored as this is very unlikely, so it is probably caused by a wrong division detection.\n\n## Contributing\n\nContributions are very welcome.
