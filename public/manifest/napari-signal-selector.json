Typically, x-axis is some temporal-related property.\n\nHere is how one could add such a layer to a napari viewer via code (check [this example notebook](./examples/synthetic_example.ipynb) for more details):\n\n```python\nviewer.add_labels(labels_image, features = table)\n```\n\nIf a layer like this is selected, you can choose what to plot by means of dropdown fields in the bottom of the plotter.\n\nBelow is a basic example using the \"Flashing Polygons\" synthetic data:\n\n![intro](https://github.com/zoccoler/napari-signal-selector/raw/main/images/intro.gif)\n\n## Tools\n\n### Selection Tool\n\nThe selection tool (arrowhead icon) is a toggle button which enables you to select individual signals. Once activated, the icon gets highlighted and you can click over individual signals to select them. Right-clicking unselects everything.\n\n![select](https://github.com/zoccoler/napari-signal-selector/raw/main/images/select.gif)\n\nIf the region you want to click is too crowded, consider zooming in first and then selecting.\n\n![zoom-select](https://github.com/zoccoler/napari-signal-selector/raw/main/images/zoom_select.gif)\n\nAnd if you know which label you want to select, you can enable `'show selected'` from the Labels layer options to solely display one label at a time. The Lables layer picker tool may help you get the right label.\n\n![show-selected](https://github.com/zoccoler/napari-signal-selector/raw/main/images/show_selected.gif)\n\n### Annotation Tool\n\nOnce one or multiple signals are selected, you can annotate them with the annotation tool (brush with a 'plus' icon). You need to choose a signal class first.\n*Remember to right-click to remove previous selections when annotating different signal classes!*\n\n![annotation](https://github.com/zoccoler/napari-signal-selector/raw/main/images/annotation.gif)\n\nAnnotations are saved back in the table in a new column called 'Annotations'.\n*Currently multiple annotations is not possible, i.e., more than one class assigned to the same part of the signal.*\n\n### Span-Selection Tool\n\nYou can use the span-selection tool (bounded horizontal arrows icon) to sub-select one or multiple parts of signals. Right-click to unselect regions. Hold 'SHIFT' while dragging the mouse to select multiple sub-regions.\n\n![span-select](https://github.com/zoccoler/napari-signal-selector/raw/main/images/span_select.gif)\n\nYou can use this in conjunction with the annotation tool to have sub-regions from the same signal with different annotations.\n\n![](https://github.com/zoccoler/napari-signal-selector/raw/main/images/span_annotation.gif)\n\n### Deletion Tool\n\nIf you made a mistake, you can remove previous annotations by selecting signal(s) and clicking on the trash icon at the right of the toolbar (or just annotate them with class 0).\n\n![delete](https://github.com/zoccoler/napari-signal-selector/raw/main/images/delete.gif)\n\nAlso, with the selection tool enbaled, by holding 'SHIFT' and left-clicking, you can select all signals. This may be useful to delete all previous annotations.\n\n![select-delete-all](https://github.com/zoccoler/napari-signal-selector/raw/main/images/select_delete_all.gif)\n\n### Exporting Annotations\n\nThe table with annotations can be displayed in napari using the napati builtin FeaturesTableWidget via `Layers > Visualize > Features table widget`. \n\nBy the way, with `'show selected'` checked, you can click on a label row in the table and see the corresponding label in the image **...and** in the plotter!\n\nTo export the table, click on `'Save as csv...'`.\n\nAnother option is to run the following code in the napari console (replace `'Labels'` with the name of your Labels layer and `'annotations.csv'` with the desired file name or file path):\n\n```python\nimport pandas as pd\ndf = viewer.layers['Labels'].data.features\ndf.to_csv('annotations.csv')\n```\n\n## Installation\n\nYou can install `napari-signal-selector` via [pip]. Follow these steps from a terminal.\n\nWe recommend using `mamba-forge` whenever possible. Click [here](https://github.com/conda-forge/miniforge#mambaforge) to choose the right download option for your OS.\n**If you do not use `mamba-forge`, replace the `mamba` term whenever you see it below with `conda`.**\n\nCreate a conda environment :\n\n    mamba create -n nss-env napari pyqt python=3.11\n    \nActivate the environment :\n\n    mamba activate nss-env\n\nInstall `napari-signal-selector` via [pip] :\n\n    pip install napari-signal-selector\n\nAlternatively, install latest development version with :\n\n    pip install git+https://github.com/zoccoler/napari-signal-selector.git\n\n\n## Contributing\n\nContributions are very welcome.
