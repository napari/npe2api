By default, the source layer will be displayed as contours.<br><br>\n      Select whether to copy a slice, a volume, or a series across time.<br><br>\n      Checking <b>Use source label value</b> keeps the original label values.<br><br>\n      Selecting <b>Preserve target labels</b> only allows copying into background (0) regions. Otherwise, SHIFT+CLICK replaces the existing label region.\n    </td>\n    <td width=\"50%\">\n      <img alt=\"copy_labels\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/448252f2-e6a0-4bc9-ae30-42aa24aadc04\" />\n    </td>\n  </tr>\n</table>\n\n### Connected component analysis\nThere are shortcut buttons for connected components labeling, keeping the largest cluster of connected labels, and to keep the largest fragment per label.\n\n<img width=\"910\" height=\"770\" alt=\"conncomp\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/8c7f41b2-fa58-48cc-8921-29e703195401\" />\n\n### Select / delete labels that overlap with a binary mask\nAll labels that share any pixel overlap with the mask are selected or removed.\n<img width=\"1500\" height=\"844\" alt=\"select_delete\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/c3d96516-d34d-468c-9c51-3fed4e904463\" />\n\n### Binary mask interpolation\nIt is possible to interpolate a 3D or 4D mask to fill in the region in between. In 3D, this means creating a 3D volume from slices, in 4D this means creating a time series of a volume that linearly 'morphs' into a different shape.\n\n<table>\n  <tr>\n    <td width=\"40%\">\n      <img width=\"400\" alt=\"interpolate\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/74115915-936a-48cb-a6b3-415d09a9ed48\" />\n    </td>\n    <td width=\"60%\">\n      <img width=\"600\" alt=\"labelinterpolation gif\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/c7384096-478d-448e-882c-691d568e83f8\" />\n    </td>\n  </tr>\n</table>\n\n### Measuring label properties\nYou can measure label properties, including intensity (if a matching image layer is provided), area/volume, perimeter/surface area, circularity/sphericity, ellipse/ellipsoid axes in the 'Region Properties' tab. The plugin uses scikit-image regionprops with extended properties for 3D shapes based on methods from PoreSpy.\nMake sure you set the dimensions correctly in the 'Extra layer controls' tab, to distinguish between measuring in 2D + time, 3D, and 3D + time, depending on your layer dimensions (2D to 4D). Once finished, a table displays the measurements, and a filter widget allows you to select objects matching a condition. The measurements are also displayed in the 'Plot'-tab for each layer for which you ran the region properties calculation.\n\n![table_widget](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a7cd7686-7f90-46de-9864-0cac3aa77cf2)\n\n## See also\nThis plugin has taken inspiration from other napari plugins with similar and more advanced functionalities for measuring features, such as:\n\n- ![napari-skimage-regionprops](https://github.com/haesleinhuepf/napari-skimage-regionprops)\n- ![napari-pyclesperanto-assistant](https://napari-hub.org/plugins/napari-pyclesperanto-assistant)\n- ![morphometrics](https://napari-hub.org/plugins/morphometrics)\n- ![napari-clusters-plotter](https://napari-hub.org/plugins/napari-clusters-plotter)\n\n## Contributing\n\nContributions are very welcome.
