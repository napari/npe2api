Most notable color by wavelength.\n  - **Range indicator** Button to mark the min and max values of the image.\n- **PSF Report**: Adds a graded report on the quality of the PSF. <- WIP\n- **Bead Detection**: Detects beads in the image.\n- **Auto-Filling of Plugin Parameters**: Automatically populates parameters for the plugin.\n  - At least 1 input also looks better\n- **Auto Analysis of Image for PSF**: Performs automatic image analysis to ascertain the quality.\n- **CZI Reader**: Adds support for reading CZI image files.\n- **Debugging**: Adds a debug class to the IPython console. Small, but hey, we can show the psf box\n- **Error Handling**: Less likely to crash. errors points can be seen in viewer | Error UI.\n- **Bug fixes**: Fixes bugs involving zyx boxes, loading bar and other issues.\n\n## Known Issues\n\n- for autofilling, only .czi files are supported. Unlikely to work with other formats.\n- Installing plugin under paths including non-ASCII characters, like \"\u00e6\u00f8\u00e5\" cause unintended behavior.\n- The output.csv file is comma seperated with dot as decimal seperator, this might require a legacy workaround in programs like Excel.\n- Intensity for bead finder is hardcoded for now.\n- Some images might still crash in the analysis.\n- Might have missed some requirements\n\n\n## License\n\nDistributed under the terms of the [BSD-3] license,\n\"psf-analysis-CFIM\" is free and open source software\n",
