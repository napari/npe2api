The interface's goal is to assist biologists without having programming expertise by being user-friendly.\n\nIf accessible, the unit of micrometres will be used to determine the parameters; if not, pixels will be used. The calculated parameters are made up of:\n- bbox: The bounding box\u2019s minimum and maximum coordinates on the horizontal and vertical axes.\n- perimeter: perimeter of the region, measured as the length of the contour.\n- area: Region\u2019s area.\n- area_convex: Area of the convex hull image, which is the smallest convex polygon enclosing the region.\n- axis_major_length: Length of the ring boundaries\u2019 major axis.\n- axis_minor_length: Length of the ring boundaries\u2019 minor axis.\n- eccentricity: The eccentricity, which ranges from 0 to 1, is the focal distance divided by the major axis length. When the eccentricity is zero, the region becomes a circle.\n- feret_diameter_max: The maximum Feret's diameter, which is the largest distance between points across the convex hull.\n- orientation: Angle between the major axis and the vertical axis, measured in radians and ranging from -pi/2 to pi/2 anticlockwise.\n- area_growth: The area between the two ring boundaries that experiences growth over a year (except the cases of pith and bark).\n\n- For more details, check the [detailed documentation](https://montpellierressourcesimagerie.github.io/napari-tree-rings).\n\n## Installation\n\nYou can install `napari-tree-rings` via [pip]:\n\n    pip install napari-tree-rings\n\n\n## Adding other measurements\nIf you would like to add other measurements while running batch, you can modify `BatchSegmentTrunk.run` in the `src/napari_tree_rings/image/process.py`. There is an example of `area_growth` for you to see and refer to.\n\n\n## Contributing\n\nContributions are very welcome.
