The crosshair overlay is based on [this](https://github.com/napari/napari/pull/8017) and [this](https://github.com/napari/napari/blob/9d0c449553eaf1acc3be1bf9bc0c8b3eec05afc6/examples/dev/overlays.py) example.\n\n## Installation\n\nYou can install the latest development version of `napari-orthogonal-views` via [pip]:\n\n```\npip install git+https://github.com/AnniekStok/napari-orthogonal-views.git\n```\n## Usage\nThis plugin is not discoverable as a widget, but commands are available in Views>Commands Palette (CMD+SHIFT+P):\n  - Show Orthogonal Views\n  - Hide Orthogonal Views\n  - Toggle Orthogonal Views\n  - Remove Orthogonal Views\n\nOnce shown, it can also be popped up or collapsed using the checkbox in the bottom right corner 'Show orthogonal views'. \nAlternatively, you can show the orthogonal views via the console:\n\n```\nfrom napari_orthogonal_views.ortho_view_manager import show_orthogonal_views\nshow_orthogonal_views(viewer)\n```\n\nAnd access the OrthoViewManager via _get_manager:\n\n```\nfrom napari_orthogonal_views.ortho_view_manager import _get_manager\nm = _get_manager(viewer)\nm.is_shown()\nOut[6]: True\n```\n\nThe size of the orthogonal view windows can be adjusted by clicking and dragging the small dot in between the views, optionally one or two views can be hidden entirely. The checkboxes in the bottom right corner can be used to show the crosshair overlay or for more control over camera zoom and axis center syncing.\nPressing `T` on the keyboard will center all views to the current mouse location. \n\nBy default, all events (including label editing such as painting) are synced across all views. The different views share the same underlying data array and undo/redo history. \n\n## Syncing properties\nBy default, all layer properties should be synced between the layer on the main viewer and the orthoviews. However, it is possible to have more finegrained control over the synced properties via the `set_sync_filters` function, as long as it is specified *before* the orthogonal views are activated. \n\nFor example, to disable syncing of all properties on Tracks layers and specifically the contour property on Labels layers: \n\n```\nfrom napari_orthogonal_views.ortho_view_manager import _get_manager\nfrom napari.layers import Tracks, Labels\nm = _get_manager(viewer)\nsync_filters = {\n    Tracks: {\n        \"forward_exclude\": \"*\",  # disable all forward sync\n        \"reverse_exclude\": \"*\",  # disable all reverse sync\n    },\n    Labels: {\n        \"forward_exclude\": \"contour\" # exclude contour from forward syncing\n    },\n}\nm.set_sync_filters(sync_filters)\n\n```\nThen add 3D data (e.g. File > Open Sample > napari builtins > Balls (3D)). Activate the labels layer and change the contour value. You should see that the contour property is not synced from main viewer to orthoviews now. \n\n## Known issues and ongoing work\n- Deprecation warnings on `Window._qt_window`, `LayerList._get_step_size`, `LayerList._get_extent_world` (suppressed for now).\n- After removing the OrthoViewManager with `delete_and_cleanup` (Remove Orthogonal Views command), the canvas may become temporarily unresponsive. Clicking outside of Napari and then back on the Napari window usually fixes this.\n\n## Contributing\n\nContributions are very welcome.
