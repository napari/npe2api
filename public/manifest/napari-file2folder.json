Tapenade is a tool for the analysis of dense 3D tissues acquired with deep imaging microscopy. It is designed to be user-friendly and to provide a comprehensive analysis of the data.\n\nIf you use this plugin for your research, please [cite us](https://github.com/GuignardLab/tapenade/blob/main/README.md#how-to-cite).\n\n## Overview\n\n<img src=\"imgs/napari-file2folder-demo.gif\"/>\n\nThis plugin allows you to inspect (possibly large) bioimages by displaying their shape (number of elements in each dimension), and allowing you to save each element along a chosen dimension as a separate .tif file in a folder. This is useful when you have a large movie or stack of images and you want to save each frame or slice as a separate file. Optionally, the plugin allows the user to visualize the middle element of a given dimension to help the user decide which dimension to save as separate files.\n\nThe plugin currently supports the following file formats:\n- .tif\n- .ome.tiff\n- .zarr\n- .ome.zarr\n- .nd2\n- .lsm\n- .czi\n\nThis plugin leverages [tifffile], [bioio], and [zarr] to circumvent loading the entire images in memory, which allows inspection of very large images.\n\n> [!CAUTION]\n> When inspecting the middle element of a dimension, or when saving one element of a dimension as a separate file, the plugin loads the element in memory, which means that at least this lone element must fit in memory.\n\n## Installation\n\nThe plugin obviously requires [napari] to run. If you don't have it yet, follow the instructions [here](https://napari.org/stable/tutorials/fundamentals/installation.html).\n\nThe simplest way to install `napari-file2folder` is via the [napari] plugin manager. Open Napari, go to `Plugins > Install/Uninstall Packages...` and search for `napari-file2folder`. Click on the install button and you are ready to go!\n\nYou can install `napari-file2folder` via [pip]:\n\n    pip install napari-file2folder\n\n\n\n\n## Contributing\n\nContributions are very welcome.
