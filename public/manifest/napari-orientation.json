You can compute several metrics and display them as images.\n\nDefinitions:\n\n* __Orientation vector__: unitary vector describing the average orientation of the gradient of the intensity around a point in the image. Computationally this is obtained by determining the first eigenvector (i.e. largest eigenvalue) of the structure tensor matrix.\n* __Orientation field__: mapping of the orientation vectors at each point in the image.\n* __Angle field__: mapping of the orientation angle at each point in the image\n* __Energy__: sum of the tensor eigenvalues.\n* __Coherence__: ratio between the difference and the sum of the maximum and minimum tensor eigenvalues.\n* __Curvature__: rate of change in the local orientation in the direction perpendicular to that orientation.\n* __Correlation length__: distance where the radial autocorrelation of the angle field drops below 0.5\n\n#### Display Colored Orientation\n\nIt computes an image where each pixel is colored differently according to the orientation angle estimated at that position.\n\n![Example colored orientation](docs/example_colored_orientation.png)\n\n#### Display Coherence\n\nIt computes an image where the value of each pixel represents the coherence estimated at that position.\n\n![Example coherence](docs/example_coherence.png)\n\n#### Display Curvature\n\nIt computes an image where the value of each pixel represents the curvature estimated at that position.\n\n![Example coherence](docs/example_curvature.png)\n\n#### Display Angle\n\nIt computes an image where the value of each pixel represents the angle, in degrees, estimated at that position.\n\n![Example coherence](docs/example_angle.png)\n\n#### Compute statistics\n\nEstimate the average value for the following metrics: Energy, Coherence, Correlation length, Curvature.\n\nNote that Correlation length and Curvature metrics are both provided in physical units, and therefore their determination relies on the accuracy of the pixel size provided for the image. Using the napari-bioformats to open the images should guarantee that the pixel size stored in the file metadata is properly read by the plugin. In any case it always possible to adjust the pixel size from the interface.\n\n![Example statistics](docs/example_statistics.png)\n\n### Generate vector-coded images\n\nIt generates a vector layer displaying the orientation field estimated locally, over a grid with spacing defined by the user.\n\n![Example vectors](docs/example_vectors.png)\n\nThis is a separate widget because it currently only works on single frames.\n\n## Contributing\n\nContributions are very welcome. Tests can be run with [tox], please ensure\nthe coverage at least stays the same before you submit a pull request.\n\n## License\n\nDistributed under the terms of the [BSD-3] license,\n\"napari-orientation\" is free and open source software\n\n## Issues\n\nIf you encounter any problems, please file an issue along with a detailed description.\n\n## Credits\n\nThis [napari] plugin was generated with [copier] using the [napari-plugin-template] (None).\n\nThis work was inspired by the plugin [OrientationJ] for ImageJ, that was partially converted by the same developers into a [plugin for napari](https://github.com/EPFL-Center-for-Imaging/napari-orientationpy).\n\nnapari-orientation focuses on the computation of several metrics, some of them proposed in this [article](https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-019-13702-4)\n\n<!--\nDon't miss the full getting started guide to set up your new package:\nhttps://github.com/napari/napari-plugin-template#getting-started\n\nand review the napari docs for plugin developers:\nhttps://napari.org/stable/plugins/index.html\n-->\n\n[napari]: https://github.com/napari/napari\n[copier]: https://copier.readthedocs.io/en/stable/\n[BSD-3]: http://opensource.org/licenses/BSD-3-Clause\n[napari-plugin-template]: https://github.com/napari/napari-plugin-template\n[tox]: https://tox.readthedocs.io/en/latest/\n[pip]: https://pypi.org/project/pip/\n[OrientationJ]: https://github.com/Biomedical-Imaging-Group/OrientationJ\n",
