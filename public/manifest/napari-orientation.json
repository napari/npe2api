You can compute several metrics and display them as images.\n\n#### Display Colored Orientation\n\nIt computes an image where each pixel is colored differently according to the orientation angle estimated at that position.\n\n![Example colored orientation](docs/example_colored_orientation.png)\n\n#### Display Coherence\n\nIt computes an image where the value of each pixel represents the coherence estimated at that position.\n\n![Example coherence](docs/example_coherence.png)\n\n#### Display Curvature\n\nIt computes an image where the value of each pixel represents the curvature estimated at that position.\n\n![Example coherence](docs/example_curvature.png)\n\n#### Display Angle\n\nIt computes an image where the value of each pixel represents the angle, in degrees, estimated at that position.\n\n![Example coherence](docs/example_angle.png)\n\n#### Compute statistics\n\nEstimate the average value for the following metrics: Energy, Coherence, Correlation length, Curvature. The curvature is the only metric in physical units, and therefore the determination of its values relies on the accuracy of the pixel size provided for the image.\n\n![Example statistics](docs/example_statistics.png)\n\n### Generate vector-coded images\nIt generates a vector layer displaying the orientation field estimated locally, over a grid with spacing defined by the user.\n\n![Example vectors](docs/example_vectors.png)\n\nThis is a separate widget because it currently only works on single frames.\n\n\n## Contributing\n\nContributions are very welcome.
