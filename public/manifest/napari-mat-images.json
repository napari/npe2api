This can be installed via [pip](https://pypi.org/project/pip/) from [PyPI](https://pypi.org/project):\n\n    $ pip install napari>0.2.12\n\nYou can install `napari-mat-images` via [pip](https://pypi.org/project/pip/) from [PyPI](https://pypi.org/project):\n\n    $ pip install napari-mat-images\n\n## Usage\n\nOnce installed, the plugin will be used whenever trying to load a `.mat` file.\nThis can be done from the `napari` GUI or commandline:\n\n    $ napari my_file.mat\n\n## Contributing\n\nContributions are very welcome.\nTests can be run with [pytest](https://docs.pytest.org/en/latest/),\nplease ensure the coverage at least stays the same before you submit a pull request.\n\n## License\n\nDistributed under the terms of the [BSD-3](http://opensource.org/licenses/BSD-3-Clause) license, `napari-mat-images` is free and open source software\n\n## Issues\n\nIf you encounter any problems, please [file an issue](https://github.com/hectormz/napari-mat-images/issues) along with a detailed description.\n\n---\n\nThis [napari](https://github.com/napari/napari) plugin was generated with [Cookiecutter](https://github.com/audreyr/cookiecutter) along with [napari](https://github.com/napari/napari)\\'s [cookiecutter-napari-plugin](https://github.com/napari/cookiecutter-napari-plugin) template.\n\n\n",
