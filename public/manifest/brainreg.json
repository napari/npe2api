This can also be a text file pointing to the files.\n- Output directory for all intermediate and final results.\n- You must also specify the voxel sizes with the `-v` flag, see [specifying voxel size](https://brainglobe.info/documentation/general/image-definition.html#voxel-sizes) for details.\n\n### Atlas\n\nBy default, brainreg will use the 25um version of the [Allen Mouse Brain Atlas](https://mouse.brain-map.org/).\nTo use another atlas (e.g. for another species, or another resolution), you must use the `--atlas` flag, followed by the string describing the atlas, e.g.:\n\n```bash\n--atlas allen_mouse_50um\n```\n\nTo find out which atlases are available, once brainreg is installed, please run `brainglobe list`.\nThe name of the resulting atlases is the string to pass with the `--atlas` flag.\n\n### Input data orientation\n\nIf your data does not match the BrainGlobe default orientation (the origin voxel is the most anterior, superior, left-most voxel), then you must specify the orientation by using the `--orientation` flag.\nWhat follows must be a string in the [brainglobe-space](https://github.com/brainglobe/brainglobe-space) \"initials\" form, to describe the origin voxel.\n\nIf the origin of your data (first, top left voxel) is the most anterior, superior, left part of the brain, then the orientation string would be \"asl\" (anterior, superior, left), and you would use:\n\n```bash\n--orientation asl\n```\n\n### Registration options\n\nTo change how the actual registration performs, see [registration parameters](https://brainglobe.info/documentation/brainreg/user-guide/parameters.html)\n\n### Additional options\n\n- `-a` or `--additional` Paths to N additional channels to downsample to the same coordinate space.\n- `--sort-input-file` If set to true, the input text file will be sorted using natural sorting. This means that the file paths will be sorted as would be expected by a human and not purely alphabetically.\n- `--brain_geometry` Can be one of `full` (default) for full brain registration, `hemisphere_l` for left hemisphere data-set and `hemisphere_r` for right hemisphere data-set.\n\n### Misc options\n\n- `--n-free-cpus` The number of CPU cores on the machine to leave unused by the program to spare resources.\n- `--debug` Debug mode. Will increase verbosity of logging and save all intermediate files for diagnosis of software issues.\n- `--save-original-orientation` Option to save the registered atlas with the same orientation as the input data.\n\n## Visualising results\n\nIf you have installed the optional [napari](https://github.com/napari/napari) plugin, you can use napari to view your data.\nThe plugin automatically fetches the [brainglobe-napari-io](https://github.com/brainglobe/brainglobe-napari-io) which provides this functionality.\nIf you have installed only the command-line tool you can still manually install [brainglobe-napari-io](https://github.com/brainglobe/brainglobe-napari-io) and follow the steps below.\n\n### Sample space\n\nOpen napari and drag your brainreg output directory (the one with the log file) onto the napari window.\n\nVarious images should then open, including:\n\n- `Registered image` - the image used for registration, downsampled to atlas resolution\n- `atlas_name` - e.g. `allen_mouse_25um` the atlas labels, warped to your sample brain\n- `Boundaries` - the boundaries of the atlas regions\n\nIf you downsampled additional channels, these will also be loaded.\nMost of these images will not be visible by default - click the little eye icon to toggle visibility.\n\n**Note:** If you use a high resolution atlas (such as `allen_mouse_10um`), then the files can take a little while to load.\n\n![GIF illustration of loading brainreg output into napari for visualisation](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/brainglobe/napari-brainreg/master/resources/sample_space.gif)\n\n## Contributing\n\nContributions to brainreg are more than welcome.\nPlease see the [developers guide](https://brainglobe.info/developers/index.html).\n\n## Citing brainreg\n\nIf you find brainreg useful, and use it in your research, please let us know and also cite the paper:\n\n> Tyson, A.
