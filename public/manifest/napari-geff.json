The file will be loaded as a `Tracks` layer.\n\nAny node properties defined on your graph will be stored as features on your tracks layer. Edge properties\nwill be available under `layer.metadata['edge_properties']` as a dictionary, but cannot currently be displayed\nor used for visualization in `napari`.\n\nIf your file contains `image` or `labels` related objects as per the GEFF\n[spec](https://live-image-tracking-tools.github.io/geff/v0.4.0/specification/#geff_related_objects),\nthese will also be loaded alongside your `Tracks` layer.\n\nIf you wish to open your geff file into layers **programmatically**, you can do so using the `viewer.open` method:\n\n```python\nimport napari\npath = 'path/to/top_level_zarr.zarr/my-geff-group/\n\nviewer = napari.Viewer()\nlayers = viewer.open(path, plugin='napari-geff')\n```\n\n\n## Contributing\n\nContributions are very welcome. Tests can be run with [tox], please ensure\nthe coverage at least stays the same before you submit a pull request.\n\n## License\n\nDistributed under the terms of the [BSD-3] license,\n\"napari-geff\" is free and open source software\n\n## Issues\n\nIf you encounter any problems, please [file an issue] along with a detailed description.\n\n[napari]: https://github.com/napari/napari\n[copier]: https://copier.readthedocs.io/en/stable/\n[@napari]: https://github.com/napari\n[MIT]: http://opensource.org/licenses/MIT\n[BSD-3]: http://opensource.org/licenses/BSD-3-Clause\n[GNU GPL v3.0]: http://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-3.0.txt\n[GNU LGPL v3.0]: http://www.gnu.org/licenses/lgpl-3.0.txt\n[Apache Software License 2.0]: http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0\n[Mozilla Public License 2.0]: https://www.mozilla.org/media/MPL/2.0/index.txt\n[napari-plugin-template]: https://github.com/napari/napari-plugin-template\n\n[napari]: https://github.com/napari/napari\n[tox]: https://tox.readthedocs.io/en/latest/\n[pip]: https://pypi.org/project/pip/\n[PyPI]: https://pypi.org/\n",
