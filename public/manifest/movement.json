Tools such as\n[DeepLabCut](https://www.mackenziemathislab.org/deeplabcut) and\n[SLEAP](https://sleap.ai/) now allow researchers to track animal movements\nin videos with remarkable accuracy, without requiring physical markers.\nHowever, there is still a need for standardised, easy-to-use methods\nto process the tracks generated by these tools.\n\n`movement` aims to provide a consistent, modular interface for analysing\nmotion tracks, enabling steps such as data cleaning, visualisation,\nand motion quantification. We aim to support all popular animal tracking\nframeworks and file formats.\n\nFind out more on our [mission and scope](https://movement.neuroinformatics.dev/community/mission-scope.html) statement and our [roadmap](https://movement.neuroinformatics.dev/community/roadmaps.html).\n\n<!-- Start Admonitions -->\n\n> [!Warning]\n> \ud83c\udfd7\ufe0f The package is currently in early development and the interface is subject to change. Feel free to play around and provide feedback.\n\n> [!Tip]\n> If you prefer analysing your data in R, we recommend checking out the\n> [animovement](https://www.roald-arboel.com/animovement/) toolbox, which is similar in scope.\n> We are working together with its developer\n> to gradually converge on common data standards and workflows.\n\n<!-- End Admonitions -->\n\n## Join the movement\n\nContributions to movement are absolutely encouraged, whether to fix a bug, develop a new feature, or improve the documentation.\nTo help you get started, we have prepared a detailed [contributing guide](https://movement.neuroinformatics.dev/community/contributing.html).\n\n- [Chat with the team on Zulip](https://neuroinformatics.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/406001-Movement).\n- [Open an issue](https://github.com/neuroinformatics-unit/movement/issues) to report a bug or request a new feature.\n- [Follow this Zulip topic](https://neuroinformatics.zulipchat.com/#narrow/channel/406001-Movement/topic/Community.20Calls) to receive updates about upcoming Community Calls.\n\n## Citation\n\nIf you use movement in your work, please cite the following Zenodo DOI:\n\n> Nikoloz Sirmpilatze, Chang Huan Lo, Sof\u00eda Mi\u00f1ano, Brandon D.
