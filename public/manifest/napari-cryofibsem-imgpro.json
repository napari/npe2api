Using the widgets, the user can choose the input image or stack, set the function parameters, and call the function. These functions can be used in combination with each other or individually, depending on the image processing requirements. \n\n![widget.png](docs%2Fimages%2Fwidget.png)\n\n## Contributing\n\nContributions are very welcome.
