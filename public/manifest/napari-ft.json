The widget tracks changes to the source image data and scale, keeping everything synchronized.\n\n### How to Use\n\n1. Load a 2D image into napari viewer\n2. Open the widget: `Plugins -> napari-ft -> Fourier Transform Filter`\n3. Select your image from the dropdown menu\n4. The FFT-shifted Fourier transform appears in the widget\n5. Draw regions on the Fourier transform:\n   - Left-click and drag to select frequencies to keep\n   - Right-click and drag to exclude specific frequencies\n   - Use \"Shape\" button to toggle between rectangles and circles\n6. The filtered image appears automatically and updates in real-time\n7. Use mouse wheel to zoom, middle-click to pan\n8. Click \"Reset Boxes\" to clear all regions or \"Reset View\" to reset zoom/pan\n\n## Installation\n\nYou can install `napari-ft` via [pip]:\n\n```\npip install napari-ft\n```\n\nIf napari is not already installed, you can install `napari-ft` with napari and Qt via:\n\n```\npip install \"napari-ft[all]\"\n```\n\n## Testing\n\nTo test the widget, run the included test script:\n\n```bash\npython test_ft_widget.py\n```\n\nThis will open napari with a test image containing multiple frequency components.\n\n\n\n## Contributing\n\nContributions are very welcome. Tests can be run with [tox], please ensure\nthe coverage at least stays the same before you submit a pull request.\n\n## License\n\nDistributed under the terms of the [BSD-3] license,\n\"napari-ft\" is free and open source software\n\n## Issues\n\nIf you encounter any problems, please [file an issue] along with a detailed description.\n\n[napari]: https://github.com/napari/napari\n[copier]: https://copier.readthedocs.io/en/stable/\n[@napari]: https://github.com/napari\n[MIT]: http://opensource.org/licenses/MIT\n[BSD-3]: http://opensource.org/licenses/BSD-3-Clause\n[GNU GPL v3.0]: http://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-3.0.txt\n[GNU LGPL v3.0]: http://www.gnu.org/licenses/lgpl-3.0.txt\n[Apache Software License 2.0]: http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0\n[Mozilla Public License 2.0]: https://www.mozilla.org/media/MPL/2.0/index.txt\n[napari-plugin-template]: https://github.com/napari/napari-plugin-template\n\n[napari]: https://github.com/napari/napari\n[tox]: https://tox.readthedocs.io/en/latest/\n[pip]: https://pypi.org/project/pip/\n[PyPI]: https://pypi.org/\n",
