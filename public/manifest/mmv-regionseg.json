A German version is available here:* [README.de.md](README.de.md)\n\nA Napari plugin for region segmentation using flood fill\n\n----------------------------------\n\nThis [napari] plugin was generated with [copier] using the [napari-plugin-template].\n\n<!--\nDon't miss the full getting started guide to set up your new package:\nhttps://github.com/napari/napari-plugin-template#getting-started\n\nand review the napari docs for plugin developers:\nhttps://napari.org/stable/plugins/index.html\n-->\n\n## Installation\n\nYou can install `mmv-regionseg` via [pip]:\n\n    pip install mmv-regionseg\n\nTo install latest development version :\n\n    pip install git+https://github.com/MMV-Lab/mmv-regionseg.git\n\n## Documentation\n\n**MMV-RegionSeg** is a Napari plugin designed to segment three-dimensional image data based on the gray value of a selected seed point. Neighboring voxels are assigned to the same class if their intensity is sufficient similar to that of the seed point or falls within a defined tolerance range.\n\n---\n\n### Launching the Plugin\n\n1. Open Napari.\n2. Go to the **Plugins** menu.\n3. Select **MMV-RegionSeg** from the dropdown.\n\nA widget will appear on the right-hand side of the Napari window, containing buttons, labels, and a slider.\n\n---\n\n### Screenshot\n\n![MMV-RegionSeg Plugin Screenshot](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/MMV-Lab/MMV-RegionSeg/main/docs/images/plugin_screenshot1.png)\n\n---\n\n### Loading Image Data\n\nClick the **\"Read image\"** button to load a 3D image in TIFF format. A standard OS file dialog will open. Once the image is selected, Napari will display it as an **image layer**.\n\n---\n\n### Adjusting Tolerance\n\nUse the **slider** below the image loading button to set the gray-value tolerance (0%\u2013100% of the dynamic range):\n\n- **Low tolerance** \u2192 risk of incomplete region filling.\n- **High tolerance** \u2192 risk of including undesired regions.\n\n> \u26a0\ufe0f The optimal tolerance often requires some experimentation.\n\n---\n\n### Definition of the Footprint\n\nUse the **dropdown list** to select the footprint for `skimage.segmentation.flood`.\nSee also: [Flood Fill].\n\n- **6 neighbors** \u2192 Only voxels directly adjacent in X, Y, and Z are considered.\n- **18 neighbors** \u2192 Includes voxels diagonally adjacent along faces and edges.\n- **26 neighbors** \u2192 All neighboring voxels are included.\n\n---\n\n### Selecting Seed Points\n\nClick **\"Select seed points\"** to activate a new **points layer** in Napari. You can then define seed points directly in the viewer.\n\n- Each seed point is visualized.\n- Multiple seed points defined in one step are treated as one class.\n- Use Napari\u2019s **Layer Controls** to move or delete seed points.\n\n---\n\n### Segmentation Options\n\nAfter placing seed points, you can choose between two segmentation methods:\n\n#### Flood\n\nClick **Flood** to perform segmentation using `skimage.segmentation.flood`.\nThis identifies neighboring voxels within the tolerance range and saves them to a new **label layer**.\n\nYou can repeat this for additional classes by selecting new seed points. Each class receives its own label layer.\n\n#### Growth\n\nClick **Growth** to visualize the segmentation **step by step**.  \nThis simulates the growth of a region, similar to the expansion of a cell colony in a Petri dish.\n\n---\n\n### Resetting for New Segmentation\n\nAfter a label layer is created, the **points layer is removed**, allowing you to define new seed points without affecting the existing segmentation results.\n\n---\n\n## Contributing\n\nContributions are welcome!\n\nTests can be run with [tox]; please ensure that coverage does not decrease before submiting a pull request.\n\n## License\n\nDistributed under the terms of the [BSD-3] license,\n\"mmv-regionseg\" is free and open source software\n\n## Issues\n\nIf you encounter any problems, please [file an issue] along with a detailed description.\n\n[napari]: https://github.com/napari/napari\n[copier]: https://copier.readthedocs.io/en/stable/\n[@napari]: https://github.com/napari\n[MIT]: http://opensource.org/licenses/MIT\n[BSD-3]: http://opensource.org/licenses/BSD-3-Clause\n[GNU GPL v3.0]: http://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-3.0.txt\n[GNU LGPL v3.0]: http://www.gnu.org/licenses/lgpl-3.0.txt\n[Apache Software License 2.0]: http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0\n[Mozilla Public License 2.0]: https://www.mozilla.org/media/MPL/2.0/index.txt\n[napari-plugin-template]: https://github.com/napari/napari-plugin-template\n\n[file an issue]: https://github.com/MMV-Lab/mmv-regionseg/issues\n\n[napari]: https://github.com/napari/napari\n[tox]: https://tox.readthedocs.io/en/latest/\n[pip]: https://pypi.org/project/pip/\n[PyPI]: https://pypi.org/\n[Flood Fill]: https://scikit-image.org/docs/0.25.x/auto_examples/segmentation/plot_floodfill\n",
