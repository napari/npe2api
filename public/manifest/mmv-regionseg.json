Neighboring voxels are assigned to the same class if their intensity is similar to that of the seed point or falls within a defined tolerance range.\n\n---\n\n### Launching the Plugin\n\n1. Open Napari.\n2. Go to the **Plugins** menu.\n3. Select **MMV-RegionSeg** from the dropdown.\n\nThis opens a widget on the right-hand side of the Napari window, featuring several buttons, labels, and a slider.\n\n### Screenshot\n\nHere is a preview of the MMV-RegionSeg plugin in action:\n\n![MMV-RegionSeg Plugin Screenshot](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/MMV-Lab/MMV-RegionSeg/main/docs/images/plugin_screenshot.png)\n\n---\n\n### Loading Image Data\n\nClick the **\"Read image\"** button to load a 3D image in TIFF format. A standard OS file dialog will open. Once the image is selected, Napari will display it as an **image layer**.\n\n---\n\n### Adjusting Tolerance\n\nA **slider** below the image loading button allows you to set the gray value tolerance (range: **1\u201350**):\n\n- **Low tolerance**: May result in incomplete region filling.\n- **High tolerance**: May include undesired regions.\n\n> \u26a0\ufe0f Choosing the right tolerance often requires trial and error.\n\n---\n\n### Selecting Seed Points\n\nClick **\"Select seed points\"** to activate a new **points layer** in Napari. You can then define seed points by clicking directly in the viewer.\n\n- Each seed point is visualized.\n- Multiple seed points added in one step are treated as a single class.\n- Use Napari\u2019s **Layer Controls** to move or delete seed points.\n\n---\n\n### Segmentation Options\n\nAfter placing seed points, you can choose between two segmentation methods:\n\n#### Flood\n\nClick **\"Flood\"** to perform segmentation using  \n`skimage.segmentation.flood(...)`.  \nThis identifies neighboring voxels within the tolerance range and saves them to a new **label layer**.\n\nYou can repeat this process for other classes by selecting new seed points. Each class will have its own label layer.\n\n#### Growth\n\nClick **\"Growth\"** to visualize the segmentation **step by step**.  \nThis simulates the growth of a region, similar to a cell colony expanding in a Petri dish.\n\n---\n\n### Resetting for New Segmentation\n\nAfter a label layer is created for a class, the **points layer is removed**, allowing you to define new seed points without affecting the existing segmentation results.\n\n---\n\n## Contributing\n\nContributions are very welcome.
