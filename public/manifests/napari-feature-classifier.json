The csv file needs to contain a column with integer values corresponding to the label values in the label image.\nThese interactive classification workflows are well suited to visually define cell types, find mitotic cells in images, do quality control by automatically detecting missegmented cells and other tasks where a user can easily assign objects to groups.\n\n#### Initialize a classifier:\n- Start the classifier in napari by going to `Plugins -> napari-feature-classifier -> Initialize a Classifier`  \n- Provide a csv file that contains feature measurements and a column with the integer labels corresponding to the label layer you are using.\n- Choose a name (or relative path from the current working directory) for the classifier. The classifier is initially saved in the current working directory (you can change this later on).\n- Select the features you want to use for the classifier (you need to do the feature selection before initializing. The feature selection can't be changed after initialization anymore). Hold the command key to select multiple features.\n<img width=\"1831\" alt=\"Initialize Classifier\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/18033446/153727784-d7b7d44b-a7b1-479f-a4af-34e0e280c8d6.png\">\n\n\n#### Classify objects:\n- Make sure you have the label layer selected on which you want to classify\n- Select the current class with the radio buttons or by pressing 0, 1, 2, 3 or 4\n- Click on label objects in the viewer to assign them to the currently selected class\n- While you need to have the label layer active to select, sometimes you want to focus on the intensity images. You can press `v` (or manually change the opacity of the label layer) to focus on the intensity images.\n- Once you have trained enough examples, click \"Run Classifier\" (or press `t`) to run the classifier and have it make a prediction for all objects. Aim for at least a dozen annotations per class, as the classifier divides your annotations 80/20 in training and test sets. To get good performance readouts, aim for >30 annotations per class.\n- Once you get predictions, correct mistakes the classifier made and retrain it to improve its performance.\n- You can save the classifier under a different name (to move it to a new folder or to have a slightly different version of the classifier - but careful, it autosaves whenever you run it). Define the new output location and then click `Save Classifier` (you need to click the Save Classifier button. Just defining the new output path does not save it yet)\n<img width=\"1831\" alt=\"trainClassifier\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/18033446/153727960-daae2955-4368-4081-88da-1a1cdbda6e69.png\">\n\n\n#### Apply the classifier to additional images:\n- You can apply a classifier trained on one image to additional label images. Use `Plugins -> napari-feature-classifier -> Load Classifier`  \n- Select the classifier (.clf file with the name you gave above) and a csv file containing the same features as the past images.\n- Click Load Classifier, proceed as above.\n<img width=\"1831\" alt=\"LoadClassifier\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/18033446/153728100-dd60918d-c9a4-4de8-8f0e-8fd8c6a51700.png\">\n\n\n#### Export classifier results\n- To export the training data and the results of the classifier, define an Export Name (full path to an output file or just a filename ending in .csv) where the results of the classifier shall be saved\n- Click `Export Classifier Result` (Just selecting a filename is not enough, you need to click the export button)\n- The results of the classifier are save in a csv file. The first two columns are index columns: path describes the Feature Path used (and allows you to understand which image / feature dataframe a result is from) and label is an integer of the label object within that image. The predict column contains predictions of the classifier for all objects (except those that contained NaNs in their feature data) and the train column contains the annotations you made (0 for unclassified objects, 1, 2, 3 or 4 for the classes)\n![DataStructure](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/18033446/153728461-d685987d-e1a9-46ff-834b-073008252ccb.png)\n\n\nThere is a simple workflow for the classifier in the examples folder:\n- Install jupyter-lab (`pip install jupyterlab`)\n- Open the notebook in jupyter lab (Type `jupyter-lab` in the terminal when you are in the examples folder)\n- Follow the instructions to generate an example dataframe and an example label image\n- Use the classifier in napari with this simplified data\n\n## Installation\n\nThis plugin is written for the new napari npe2 plugin engine. Thus, it requires napari >= 0.4.13.\nActivate your environment where you have napari installed (or install napari using `pip install \"napari[all]\"`), then install the classifier plugin:\n\n    pip install napari-feature-classifier\n    \n\n## Contributing\n\nContributions are very welcome.\n\n## License\n\nDistributed under the terms of the [BSD-3] license,\n\"napari-feature-classifier\" is free and open source software\n\n## Issues\n\nIf you encounter any problems, please [file an issue] along with a detailed description.\n\n## Contributors\n[Joel L\u00fcthi](https://github.com/jluethi) & [Max Hess](https://github.com/MaksHess)\n\n[napari]: https://github.com/napari/napari\n[Cookiecutter]: https://github.com/audreyr/cookiecutter\n[@napari]: https://github.com/napari\n[MIT]: http://opensource.org/licenses/MIT\n[BSD-3]: http://opensource.org/licenses/BSD-3-Clause\n[GNU GPL v3.0]: http://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-3.0.txt\n[GNU LGPL v3.0]: http://www.gnu.org/licenses/lgpl-3.0.txt\n[Apache Software License 2.0]: http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0\n[Mozilla Public License 2.0]: https://www.mozilla.org/media/MPL/2.0/index.txt\n[cookiecutter-napari-plugin]: https://github.com/napari/cookiecutter-napari-plugin\n\n[napari]: https://github.com/napari/napari\n[tox]: https://tox.readthedocs.io/en/latest/\n[pip]: https://pypi.org/project/pip/\n[PyPI]: https://pypi.org/\n\n\n", "description_content_type": "text/markdown", "keywords": null, "home_page": "https://github.com/fractal-napari-plugins-collection/napari-feature-classifier", "download_url": null, "author": "Joel Luethi and Max Hess", "author_email": "joel.luethi@uzh.ch", "maintainer": null, "maintainer_email": null, "license": "BSD-3-Clause", "classifier": ["Development Status :: 2 - Pre-Alpha", "Intended Audience :: Developers", "Framework :: napari", "Topic :: Software Development :: Testing", "Programming Language :: Python", "Programming Language :: Python :: 3", "Programming Language :: Python :: 3.7", "Programming Language :: Python :: 3.8", "Programming Language :: Python :: 3.9", "Programming Language :: Python :: 3.10", "Operating System :: OS Independent", "License :: OSI Approved :: BSD License"], "requires_dist": ["numpy", "napari", "matplotlib", "magicgui", "pandas", "sklearn"], "requires_python": ">=3.7", "requires_external": null, "project_url": null, "provides_extra": null, "provides_dist": null, "obsoletes_dist": null}, "npe1_shim": false}
